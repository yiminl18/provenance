This property of personal informatics systems opens several 
opportunities for research and applications. Many existing 
technologies are capable of collecting various types of 
personal information, and researchers in ubiquitous 
computing and lifelogging are developing new collection 
tools. How can personal informatics systems leverage these 
new technologies to inform people about different facets of 
their lives? What would visualizations that show multiple 
facets of people's lives look like? How should they be 
designed so that non-experts (most people) can gain 
insights about their lives?
Limitations of the Survey and Model
We recruited participants from a blog dedicated to personal 
informatics, a blog about general information visualization, 
and two personal informatics web sites, so most survey 
participants were familiar with personal informatics. Since 
even these interested users had plenty of problems with
different systems, we suspect that the problems they 
encountered may be a subset of problems that common
users may experience. We think it would be interesting to 
study users with little or no prior experience with personal 
informatics systems to find specific barriers that they may 
encounter.
CASE STUDIES
Having identified the stages model, the properties of the 
stages, and the barriers experienced within the stages, we 
can now apply the model to analyze personal informatics 
systems. In this section, we evaluate existing personal 
informatics systems to demonstrate the use of the model. In 
consideration of space, we only highlight some aspects of 
each system. We describe barriers that users may encounter 
and suggest potential solutions to explore further.

 communicate. 60% of them used social networking sites 
daily. Most read news websites and blogs, ordered products 
online, and managed bills and bank accounts online.
RESULTS
We created affinity diagrams to analyze the survey and 
interviews. We did not determine a coding scheme 
beforehand; instead we identified themes from the data as 
we processed the responses. During the analysis, we 
identified the types of personal information collected and 
reflected on by participants, motivations for collection and 
reflection, and problems experienced. Next, we analyzed 
the survey and interviews for experiences with tools and 
barriers that users encountered, identifying a model of 
personal informatics.
Collected Personal Information
Participants reported a wide variety of information that they 
collected and reflected on (see Table 1). Many participants 
reflected on automatically collected information such as 
bank statements and email history, since they are readily 
available. Automatically collected information was split

depending on his hypotheses (e.g., what is the effect of 
caffeine consumption on my sleep patterns?).
The iterative property of personal informatics systems 
suggests that systems should be flexible to support users' 
changing information needs. Systems could be flexible by 
1) supporting importing data from other systems, as well as, 
exporting to other systems; and 2) supporting different 
kinds of information. Since tool changes may render 
previously collected data useless, systems should support 
rapid iteration, so that users can quickly hone in on the 
questions they want to answer and select the appropriate 
tools to collect the necessary information.
User-driven vs. System-driven 
Each stage can be classified as user-driven, system-driven, 
or a combination of both. When a stage is user-driven, the 
user is responsible for the activity in the stage. In the 
Preparation stage, the user decides what type of information 
to collect and what tools to use. User-driven collection is 
when users record information on paper or enter 
information into a spreadsheet, an application, or a website 
form. User-driven integration is when users have to 
transcribe collected information, so that they can reflect on 
it. In the Reflection stage, the user reflects on the 
information without the aid of visualizations or other tools 
for exploring the data. In the Action stage, the user is 
responsible for deciding on actions to take depending on 
their conclusions from the data without aid from the system.
User-driven stages demand time and attention from the 
user. This is problematic when the demand becomes too 
much (e.g., high frequency of collection). There are ways to 
facilitate user-driven stages. For example, systems that use 
user-driven collection can motivate the user to collect the 
information. Hsieh and colleagues [11] have explored this

 section, the survey asked what patterns, trends, and 
surprises participants found from reflecting on their 
information. The survey ended with demographics 
questions (e.g., gender, age range, marital status, 
employment, education, and technology use). The 
following are example questions from the survey1:
• How difficult is it to collect this personal information?
• What was your initial motivation to reflect on this 
collected personal information?
• What patterns (repeating events) have you found when 
exploring this collected personal information?

forums at two personal informatics web sites
(http://slifelabs.com and http://moodjam.org). We chose 
these web sites because their readers and users were more 
likely to have used one or more personal informatics 
systems. Survey participants were entered into a raffle for a 
$25 Amazon gift certificate. We interviewed a subset of 
these participants using instant messenger to collect 
additional details about their responses. Interviewees 
received an additional $10 Amazon gift certificate. 
We had 68 people complete the surveys, and 11 agreed to 
participate in the follow-up interviews. 37 participants were 
male. Ages ranged from 18 to 64 with a median age range 
of 26 to 30. About half had graduate degrees and another 
half were in college. More than half worked full-time. 
Participants were technologically savvy. 90% of 
participants used email or instant messenger daily to 
communicate. 60% of them used social networking sites 
daily. Most read news websites and blogs, ordered products 
online, and managed bills and bank accounts online.

2024-06-21 13:50:40,062 - root - INFO - final_answer: The statistical methods commonly used when processing data from user studies include affinity diagrams, coding schemes for themes, and iterative analysis of collected personal information. These methods are instrumental in identifying patterns, motivations, and barriers experienced by users during the reflection on and collection of personal information. Moreover, the data processing and analysis within personal informatics systems involve both user-driven and system-driven stages. 

In analyzing data from user studies, statistical methods are employed to evaluate existing personal informatics systems and demonstrate the model's utility. The iterative nature of personal informatics systems necessitates flexibility to accommodate users' evolving information needs and support rapid iterations for users to focus on their desired questions efficiently. User-driven stages in personal informatics systems require time and attention from the user, and there are strategies to facilitate these stages, such as motivating users to gather relevant information.
