2024-06-12 18:54:48,693 - root - INFO - final_answer: To determine the number of disaster projects starting later than 2021, we can look at the information provided in the sub-answers:

1. "There are no disaster projects in construction at this time."
2. "The estimated schedule for disaster projects starting after 2021 is to be determined. There are no disaster projects under construction at this time. The City will apply for future grant funding for Phase Two of the Emergency Warning Sirens project."

Based on the provided information, it is clear that there are no disaster projects currently in construction, and the schedule for projects starting after 2021 is yet to be determined.
