 5 STUDY 3 – SHORT FIELD STUDY
Kjeldskov and Skov [47] and Baillie and Schatz [6] 
underline the importance of conducting short in situ 
evaluations as lab-based ones could leave usability or UX 
issues unrevealed. We, therefore, evaluated the app during 
a short field study with UPs. When evaluating an app for 
older adults with age-related macular degeneration,
Hakobyan et al. [26] conducted a preliminary 7 days 
evaluation study before carrying on with a 6 weeks 
longitudinal field one. Previous sensor research [34, 39] 
found differences between weekdays and weekends and 
recommend undertaking a study which lasts at least a week 
(best 9-11 days) and collects both weekday and weekend 
data. Given this, we ran the study for 9 days.
5.1 Methodology
The study was divided into three phases (Table 3) and 
aimed to discover app usability issues, collect sensor data to 
understand how people interact with the app in the field, 
and understand if users’ design decisions from previous 
studies hold when using the app in a real-life context.

Phase Content
Phase 1 Set Up App installation and usability 
evaluation.
Phase 2 Field 
Study
Nine days uncontrolled field study.
Phase 3 
Uninstallation
App uninstallation and usability 
evaluation.
We started by posting invitations on social media and flyers 
around universities, libraries and leisure centers. We also 
emailed prostate cancer support groups. As people were not 
coming forward, we also advertised the study over the 
radio. We recruited six UPs (UP15-20), three males and 
three females, age range 26 – 66, mean age 54.6. Most UPs 
(5/6) agreed or strongly agreed they were confident using a 
smartphone. No UP was aware of other OAB apps.
The first phase was a face to face or Skype interview in 
which the app was installed on UPs’ phone. After 
installation, UPs were asked to interact with the app by

This study was a nine-day uncontrolled field study that involved the recruitment of six user participants (three males and three females) with an age range of 26-66. The primary objectives of this study were to identify app usability issues and gather sensor data on user interactions with the app in a real-life setting.
