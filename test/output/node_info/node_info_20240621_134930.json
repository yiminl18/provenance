This stage concerns itself with \\r\\npeople’s motivation to collect personal information, how \\r\\nthey determine what information they will record, and how \\r\\nthey will record it.\\r\\nBarriers in the Preparation stage are related to determining \\r\\nwhat information to collect and what collection tool to use. \\r\\nAs noted, some people stumble upon tools, which drive \\r\\nthem to start collecting. However, this becomes a problem \\r\\nwhen the tool does not satisfy their information needs. This \\r\\ncauses them to switch to another tool, which has two \\r\\nnegative consequences: 1) they abandon their previous data \\r\\nbecause most systems do not support data exporting, and 2) \\r\\nif they can export data, the formats between the applications \\r\\nmay not be the same.
