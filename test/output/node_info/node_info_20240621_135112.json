In the \\r\\nIntegration stage, the system can aggregate and prepare the \\r\\ninformation for reflection, e.g., Mint aggregates data from \\r\\ndifferent banks and credit card companies. In the Reflection \\r\\nstage, the system can help users reflect on and explore their \\r\\ninformation using visualizations. In the Action stage, \\r\\nsystems can alert the user to take action, e.g., Wakoopa \\r\\n(http://wakoopa.com) suggests new applications and \\r\\nwebsites depending on the person's computer usage.\\r\\nThis property of the stages suggests that there are \\r\\nopportunities within each stage of a system to use a system\\x02driven approach to alleviate the demands on the user. \\r\\nHowever, designers should consider the tradeoffs between a \\r\\nsystem-driven approach (e.g., inaccuracies of automated \\r\\nanalysis, and loss of user control) and a user-driven \\r\\napproach (e.g., burden and complexity).
