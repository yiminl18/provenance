We, therefore, evaluated the app during \\na short field study with UPs. When evaluating an app for \\nolder adults with age-related macular degeneration, \\nHakobyan et al. [26] conducted a preliminary 7 days \\nevaluation study before carrying on with a 6 weeks \\nlongitudinal field one. Previous sensor research [34, 39] \\nfound differences between weekdays and weekends and \\nrecommend undertaking a study which lasts at least a week \\n(best 9-11 days) and collects both weekday and weekend \\ndata. Given this, we ran the study for 9 days. \\n5.1 Methodology \\nThe study was divided into three phases (Table 3) and \\naimed to discover app usability issues, collect sensor data to \\nunderstand how people interact with the app in the field, \\nand understand if users’ design decisions from previous \\nstudies hold when using the app in a real-life context. \\nTable 3.
