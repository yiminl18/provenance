Perform query merging, given a initial question,                 a list of its sub-queries and sub-answers, merge them into a final answer.                 These sub-answers are generated correspondingly from the sub-questions that                 have been well decomposed.                 Hence you need to find an intersection between the sub-answers to generate the final answer                 for the initial question.                 If there are acronyms or words you are not familiar with, do not try to rephrase them.                Your final answer should be a well-structured and coherent response to the initial question.\nHuman: {'question': 'What are the names of projects starting before 2022?
