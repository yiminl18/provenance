How can personal informatics systems leverage these \\nnew technologies to inform people about different facets of \\ntheir lives? What would visualizations that show multiple \\nfacets of people's lives look like? How should they be \\ndesigned so that non-experts (most people) can gain \\ninsights about their lives? \\nLimitations of the Survey and Model \\nWe recruited participants from a blog dedicated to personal \\ninformatics, a blog about general information visualization, \\nand two personal informatics web sites, so most survey \\nparticipants were familiar with personal informatics. Since \\neven these interested users had plenty of problems with \\ndifferent systems, we suspect that the problems they \\nencountered may be a subset of problems that common \\nusers may experience. We think it would be interesting to \\nstudy users with little or no prior experience with personal \\ninformatics systems to find specific barriers that they may \\nencounter. \\nCASE STUDIES \\nHaving identified the stages model, the properties of the \\nstages, and the barriers experienced within the stages, we \\ncan now apply the model to analyze personal informatics \\nsystems. In this section, we evaluate existing personal \\ninformatics systems to demonstrate the use of the model. In \\nconsideration of space, we only highlight some aspects of \\neach system. We describe barriers that users may encounter \\nand suggest potential solutions to explore further. \\nTwitter-based systems\", metadata={'author': 'Ian Li, Anind Dey, Jodi Forlizzi', 'chunk_index': 31.0, 'creationDate': 'D:20100125203330Z', 'creator': 'Microsoft Word', 'file_path': 'data/paper/raw_data/A Stage-based Model of Personal Informatics Systems.pdf', 'format': 'PDF 1.3', 'keywords': 'barriers, collection, model, personal informatics, reflection', 'modDate': \"D:20240325173845-07'00'\", 'page': 7.0, 'producer': 'Mac OS X 10.5.7 Quartz PDFContext; modified using iText 4.2.0 by 1T3XT', 'source': 'data/paper/raw_data/A Stage-based Model of Personal Informatics Systems.pdf', 'start_index': 1979.0, 'subject': '', 'title': 'A stage-based model of personal informatics systems', 'total_pages': 10.0, 'trapped': ''}), Document(page_content=\"caffeine consumption, meal times, weight) into the reports \\ndepending on his hypotheses (e.g., what is the effect of \\ncaffeine consumption on my sleep patterns?). \\nThe iterative property of personal informatics systems \\nsuggests that systems should be flexible to support users' \\nchanging information needs. Systems could be flexible by \\n1) supporting importing data from other systems, as well as, \\nexporting to other systems; and 2) supporting different \\nkinds of information. Since tool changes may render \\npreviously collected data useless, systems should support \\nrapid iteration, so that users can quickly hone in on the \\nquestions they want to answer and select the appropriate \\ntools to collect the necessary information. \\nUser-driven vs. System-driven  \\nEach stage can be classified as user-driven, system-driven, \\nor a combination of both. When a stage is user-driven, the \\nuser is responsible for the activity in the stage. In the \\nPreparation stage, the user decides what type of information \\nto collect and what tools to use. User-driven collection is \\nwhen users record information on paper or enter \\ninformation into a spreadsheet, an application, or a website \\nform. User-driven integration is when users have to \\ntranscribe collected information, so that they can reflect on \\nit. In the Reflection stage, the user reflects on the \\ninformation without the aid of visualizations or other tools \\nfor exploring the data. In the Action stage, the user is \\nresponsible for deciding on actions to take depending on \\ntheir conclusions from the data without aid from the system. \\nUser-driven stages demand time and attention from the \\nuser. This is problematic when the demand becomes too \\nmuch (e.g., high frequency of collection). There are ways to \\nfacilitate user-driven stages. For example, systems that use \\nuser-driven collection can motivate the user to collect the \\ninformation.
