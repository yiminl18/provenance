            "The company being informed later than 2023 and located in California is not specifically identified in the provided sub-answers. The first sub-answer mentions a company that was informed later than 2023 about probable violations and a proposed compliance order, with a response requested within 30 days. However, the second sub-answer simply states \"I don't know.\" Since there is no overlap or clear identification of a company meeting both criteria, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the initial question."
