Interviewees \\r\\nreceived an additional $10 Amazon gift certificate. \\r\\nWe had 68 people complete the surveys, and 11 agreed to \\r\\nparticipate in the follow-up interviews. 37 participants were \\r\\nmale. Ages ranged from 18 to 64 with a median age range \\r\\nof 26 to 30. About half had graduate degrees and another \\r\\nhalf were in college. More than half worked full-time. \\r\\nParticipants were technologically savvy. 90% of \\r\\nparticipants used email or instant messenger daily to \\r\\ncommunicate. 60% of them used social networking sites \\r\\ndaily. Most read news websites and blogs, ordered products \\r\\nonline, and managed bills and bank accounts online.\\r\\nRESULTS', metadata={'chunk_index': 8.0, 'page': 2.0, 'source': 'data/paper/raw_data/A Stage-based Model of Personal Informatics Systems.pdf', 'start_index': 1993.0})]"
