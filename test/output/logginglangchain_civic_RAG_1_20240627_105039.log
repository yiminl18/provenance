to integrate with may motivate someone to resume tracking. 
p20 stopped using Foursquare because there was “less of a 
motivation to check in”, but later resumed because she “got 
a Pebble and you can check in on Foursquare from your 
Pebble.” People also return to tools when their goals align 
with what the tools can support. p18 used MyFitnessPal to 
help her lose weight, lost interest in the tool, and resumed 
using MyFitnessPal to help with weight loss two years later.

ABSTRACT 
Current models of how people use personal informatics 
systems are largely based in behavior change goals. They do 
not adequately characterize the integration of self-tracking 
into everyday life by people with varying goals. We build 
upon prior work by embracing the perspective of lived 
informatics to propose a new model of personal informatics. 
We examine how lived informatics manifests in the habits of 
self-trackers across a variety of domains, first by surveying 
105, 99, and 83 past and present trackers of physical activity, 
finances, and location and then by interviewing 22 trackers 
regarding their lived informatics experiences. We develop a 
model characterizing tracker processes of deciding to track 
and selecting a tool, elaborate on tool usage during collection, 
integration, and reflection as components of tracking and 
acting, and discuss the lapsing and potential resuming of 
tracking. We use our model to surface underexplored 
challenges in lived informatics, thus identifying future 
directions for personal informatics design and research.

INTRODUCTION 
Personal informatics, or collecting and reflecting on personal 
information, has become increasingly prevalent. Personal 
informatics can serve a goal-driven purpose, such as tracking 
weight loss, increasing physical activity, having a record of 
places visited, or tracking student loan payments. Beyond

 and people sometimes return to tracking. Finding a new tool 
to integrate with may motivate someone to resume tracking. 
p20 stopped using Foursquare because there was “less of a 
motivation to check in”, but later resumed because she “got 
a Pebble and you can check in on Foursquare from your 
Pebble.” People also return to tools when their goals align 
with what the tools can support. p18 used MyFitnessPal to 
help her lose weight, lost interest in the tool, and resumed 
using MyFitnessPal to help with weight loss two years later.
