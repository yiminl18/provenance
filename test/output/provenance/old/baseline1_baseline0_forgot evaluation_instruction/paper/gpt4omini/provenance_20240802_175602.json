        "After reading all the papers in our corpus, we conducted an\nanalysis  based  on  a  grounded  theory  approach  [27].\nCombining  our  answers  to  the  above  questions  with  other\nnotes  and  observations,  we  developed  a  list  of  salient\nthemes emerging from our discussions of the papers. These\nthemes became the  basis for  a  series  of  memos,  with each\nmemo both describing one theme or pattern and indicating\nthe reason for its interest or significance. The memos were\nthen  circulated  among  the  authors,  who  discussed  them\nfurther,  refined  them,  and  considered  relationships  among\nthem. These memos, and the themes they describe, form the\nbasis for the following sections.",
