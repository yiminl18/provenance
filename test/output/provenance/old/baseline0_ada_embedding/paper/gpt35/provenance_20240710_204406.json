        "Models of Personal Informatics \nLi et al. develop a stage-based model of personal informatics \nsystems  and  describe  barriers  people  face  in  each  stage \n(Figure 1) [21]. The model has five stages: 1) preparation, or \nstarting to collect data and thinking about what information \nto  record  and  how  to  collect  it;  2)  collection,  or  gathering \ndata;  3)  integration,  or  preparing  data  to  reflect  upon; \n4) reflection, or examining and exploring data; and 5) action, \nor  taking  one’s  newfound  understanding  of  themselves  to \ninform changes. Motivated by the Transtheoretical Model of \nBehavior  Change  (TTM)  [32],  Li  et  al.  later  identify  two \nphases  of  reflection,  discovery  and  maintenance,  and  note \npeople ask different types of questions in each phase [22].",
        "DISCUSSION \nOur revised model of personal informatics offers guidance and \ndesign  challenges  for  the  personal  informatics  community. \nSome  guidelines  are  consistent  with  those  suggested  by \nRooksby et al., including to consider the agency of people \nand how they want to self-track [34]. We supplement these \nguidelines  by  recommending  that  designers  plan  for  lapse \nand  resumption,  consider  people  migrating  between  tools, \nand support people adjusting their tracking goals.",
