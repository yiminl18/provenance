        "Models of Personal Informatics \nLi et al. develop a stage-based model of personal informatics \nsystems  and  describe  barriers  people  face  in  each  stage \n(Figure 1) [21]. The model has five stages: 1) preparation, or \nstarting to collect data and thinking about what information \nto  record  and  how  to  collect  it;  2)  collection,  or  gathering \ndata;  3)  integration,  or  preparing  data  to  reflect  upon; \n4) reflection, or examining and exploring data; and 5) action, \nor  taking  one’s  newfound  understanding  of  themselves  to \ninform changes. Motivated by the Transtheoretical Model of \nBehavior  Change  (TTM)  [32],  Li  et  al.  later  identify  two \nphases  of  reflection,  discovery  and  maintenance,  and  note \npeople ask different types of questions in each phase [22].",
        "DISCUSSION \nOur revised model of personal informatics offers guidance and \ndesign  challenges  for  the  personal  informatics  community. \nSome  guidelines  are  consistent  with  those  suggested  by \nRooksby et al., including to consider the agency of people \nand how they want to self-track [34]. We supplement these \nguidelines  by  recommending  that  designers  plan  for  lapse \nand  resumption,  consider  people  migrating  between  tools, \nand support people adjusting their tracking goals.",

        "ABSTRACT \nCurrent  models  of  how  people  use  personal  informatics \nsystems are largely based in behavior change goals. They do \nnot  adequately  characterize  the  integration  of  self-tracking \ninto  everyday  life  by  people  with  varying  goals.  We  build \nupon  prior  work  by  embracing  the  perspective  of  lived \ninformatics to propose a new model of personal informatics. \nWe examine how lived informatics manifests in the habits of \nself-trackers across a variety of domains, first by surveying \n105, 99, and 83 past and present trackers of physical activity, \nfinances, and location and then by interviewing 22 trackers \nregarding their lived informatics experiences. We develop a \nmodel characterizing tracker processes of deciding to track \nand selecting a tool, elaborate on tool usage during collection, \nintegration,  and  reflection  as  components  of  tracking  and \nacting,  and  discuss  the  lapsing  and  potential  resuming  of \ntracking",
        "INTRODUCTION \nPersonal informatics, or collecting and reflecting on personal \ninformation,  has  become  increasingly  prevalent.  Personal \ninformatics can serve a goal-driven purpose, such as tracking \nweight loss, increasing physical activity, having a record of \nplaces  visited,  or  tracking  student  loan  payments.  Beyond \nthese goal-driven motivations, self-tracking tools are now a \npart  of  everyday  life,  or  “lived  informatics”,  with  people \ntracking out of curiosity or a fascination with numbers [34]. \nThe pervasiveness of self-tracking tools has led researchers \nto  study  people’s  use  of  commercial  tools  for  tracking \nlocation  [24,30],  finances  [20],  food  [11],  weight  [19,25], \nand  physical  activity  [16,34]  and  to  develop  research \nprototypes to expand our understanding of usage [3,8,12,40]."
