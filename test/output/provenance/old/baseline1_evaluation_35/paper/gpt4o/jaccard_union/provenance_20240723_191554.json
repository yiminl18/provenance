Their line of reasoning suggests that showing users\ndata  about  themselves  will  lead  them  to do  something,\npresumably  something  different  from  and  better  than  what\nthey  are  already  doing.  For  example,  showing  diabetics\nblood sugar levels will increase their ability to manage their\ncondition  [25];  showing  frequency  of  shortcut  key  usage\nwill increase their usage [62]; showing mouse accuracy will\nreduce  exaggerated  movements  and  improve  future\nperformance  [44].

        "While  this  rhetorical  positioning  comes  across  clearly  in\npersonal informatics, many papers in our review that were\nnot identified by the authors under that umbrella still cited\nsimilar  motivations.  For  example, Mathur  and  Karahalios\ndescribe  a  visualization  system  based  on  bookmarks  in  a\nweb  browser  wherein  “the  user  is  able  to  notice  things\nabout  oneself  that  he  or  she  did  not  notice  before”\n[65:4657].",
        "The Constitution of Reflection\nMany  of  the  papers  in  this  review  described  interventions\ndesigned  to  support  or  encourage  reflection  in  some  way.\nHowever, the lack of definition or deeper engagement with\nthe  concept  of  reflection  poses  challenges  for  design.  For\nexample,  what  does  it  take  to  reflect?  How  can\ninterventions  provide  spaces  that  are  conducive  to\nreflection?  As  mentioned  above,  the  Personal  Informatics\nmodel  described  reflection as “looking at lists  of  collected\npersonal  information  or  exploring  or  interacting  with\ninformation  visualizations,”  [55:562].  This  definition\ncarries  an  implicit  assumption  that  by  providing  access  to\ndata  that  has  been  “prepared,  combined,  and  transformed”\n[55:561] for the purpose of reflection, reflection will occur.\nThe majority of the interventions in our review held similar"
