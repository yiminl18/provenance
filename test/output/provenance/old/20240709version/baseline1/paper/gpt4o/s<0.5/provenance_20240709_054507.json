We  started  with  MPs  interviews  as  we \nwished  to  understand  whether  they  agreed  with  the \nconcepts  derived  from  the  literature  and  whether  they \nwould  suggest  additional  ones.  We  interviewed  four  MPs: \ntwo  medical  consultants \ntwo  urinary \ncontinence specialist nurses (MP3-4). Three interviews were \nconducted  via  telephone  and  one  face-to-face  (MP2).
