We  know  that  people  want  to  get \ninformation about themselves to reflect on, and that systems \nthat support this activity need to be effective and simple to \nuse.

Benjamin  Franklin  tracked \nthe days in which he accomplished one of his 13 virtues for \n60  years  [5].  Buckminster  Fuller  documented  every  15 \nminutes of his life in a scrapbook he called the “Dymaxion \nChronofile”.  These  days,  there  are  people  like  Nicholas \nFelton,  who  has  been  publishing  annual  reports  about \nhimself since 2005 (http://feltron.com), and Ellie Harrison, \nwho  created  art  projects  on  her  personal  behavior,  such  as \nfood  consumption  and  sneezes  (http://ellieharrison.com). \nThese  are  extreme  examples,  but  regular  people  are \ntracking one or two types of personal information and using \ncomputing  technology  in  the  form  of  personal  informatics \nsystems to do so."
