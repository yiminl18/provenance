We  started  with  MPs  interviews  as  we \nwished  to  understand  whether  they  agreed  with  the \nconcepts  derived  from  the  literature  and  whether  they \nwould  suggest  additional  ones.  We  interviewed  four  MPs: \ntwo  medical  consultants \ntwo  urinary \ncontinence specialist nurses (MP3-4). Three interviews were \nconducted  via  telephone  and  one  face-to-face  (MP2).  Each \ninterview lasted one hour and was divided into three phases \n(Table 1). \n\n(MP1-2)  and",

All  UPs  strongly  agree  or  agree  with  the \nfeature  and \ninformation  provided  useful. \nAlthough it has been suggested to include videos, only one \nmale  UP  watched  the  two  available  videos.  UP17,  already \nfamiliar  with  the  exercises  declared  “I  didn't  watch  the \nvideos as I am already doing them. Maybe to refresh but after \n3 years I think I'm doing them right.”. \n\nToilet  Pass:  Half  of  the  UPs  strongly  agree  with  it. \nAlthough it has been accessed multiple times, no UP used it \nin  unknown  places:  “It might be useful.

We, therefore, evaluated the  app  during \na  short  field  study  with  UPs.  When  evaluating  an  app  for \nolder  adults  with  age-related  macular  degeneration, \nHakobyan  et  al.  [26]  conducted  a  preliminary  7  days \nevaluation  study  before  carrying  on  with  a  6  weeks \nlongitudinal  field  one.  Previous  sensor  research  [34,  39] \nfound  differences  between  weekdays  and  weekends  and \nrecommend undertaking a study which lasts at least a week \n(best  9-11  days)  and  collects  both  weekday  and  weekend \ndata. Given this, we ran the study for 9 days."
