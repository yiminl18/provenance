We  started  with  MPs  interviews  as  we \nwished  to  understand  whether  they  agreed  with  the \nconcepts  derived  from  the  literature  and  whether  they \nwould  suggest  additional  ones.  We  interviewed  four  MPs: \ntwo  medical  consultants \ntwo  urinary \ncontinence specialist nurses (MP3-4). Three interviews were \nconducted  via  telephone  and  one  face-to-face  (MP2).  Each \ninterview lasted one hour and was divided into three phases \n(Table 1). \n\n(MP1-2)  and",

We, therefore, evaluated the  app  during \na  short  field  study  with  UPs.  When  evaluating  an  app  for \nolder  adults  with  age-related  macular  degeneration, \nHakobyan  et  al.  [26]  conducted  a  preliminary  7  days \nevaluation  study  before  carrying  on  with  a  6  weeks \nlongitudinal  field  one.  Previous  sensor  research  [34,  39] \nfound  differences  between  weekdays  and  weekends  and \nrecommend undertaking a study which lasts at least a week \n(best  9-11  days)  and  collects  both  weekday  and  weekend \ndata. Given this, we ran the study for 9 days.",
