        "8  CONCLUSION \nThis paper  presents  an  exploratory study  in  which  we  co-\ndesigned  and  then  evaluated  with  people  with  OAB  and \nhealth professionals an OAB mHealth app. We commenced \nwith an  OAB and  mHealth  app literature review and  used \nthis as the basis for our requirements gathering interviews. \nBased on the data collected we designed the first prototype \nand validated it again with the same stakeholder categories. \nGiven  the  second  round  of  feedback,  we  improved  the \ndesign of the app and evaluated it in a field study for nine \ndays with people with OAB."
