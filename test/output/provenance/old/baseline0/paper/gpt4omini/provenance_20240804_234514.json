        "After reading all the papers in our corpus, we conducted an\nanalysis  based  on  a  grounded  theory  approach  [27].\nCombining  our  answers  to  the  above  questions  with  other\nnotes  and  observations,  we  developed  a  list  of  salient\nthemes emerging from our discussions of the papers. These\nthemes became the  basis for  a  series  of  memos,  with each\nmemo both describing one theme or pattern and indicating\nthe reason for its interest or significance. The memos were\nthen  circulated  among  the  authors,  who  discussed  them\nfurther,  refined  them,  and  considered  relationships  among\nthem. These memos, and the themes they describe, form the\nbasis for the following sections.",

        "RESULTS – THEMES AND PATTERNS\nIn  total,  our  corpus  included  76  papers,  all  published\nbetween 2000 and 2013. The average publication year was\n2010 and the median 2011. A plurality of papers come from\nthe  ACM  SIGCHI  conference,  either  the  full  proceedings\n(13 papers) or the extended abstracts (16). The later include\na mix of workshop descriptions, works in progress, posters,\netc. The next largest contingent appears in the Creativity &\nCognition  conference  (8).  The  remainder  occurred  in  such\nvenues  as  Designing  Interactive  Systems  (3),  Artificial\nIntelligence  and  Education  (3),  iConference  (2),  Tangible\nand  Embedded  Computing  (2),  and  other  similar  venues",

What are the stated benefits of reflection?\n\nThese questions were not meant to be restrictive, i.e., these\nwere not the only aspects of these papers in which we were\ninterested.  Rather,  they  were  meant  to  provide  generative\nguidance—what patterns, trends, or themes might be noted\nby  attending  to  these  questions? After  formulating  our  list\nof  questions,  the  papers  were  evenly  divided  among  the\nauthors. Each author read her or his papers, both answering\nour  list  of  questions  and  noting  other  trends.  The  authors\nalso  met  periodically  throughout  the  reading  process  to\ndiscuss both observations and questions.",
