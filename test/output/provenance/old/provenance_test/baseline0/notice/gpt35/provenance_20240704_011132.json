Kiantone failed to produce \nany records for calendar years 2019 through 2021.  Subsequently, PHMSA requested records of \nany  leak  evaluations ever  performed  and  Kiantone  discussed  that they  do  not  have  a record  or \nevaluation on the leak detection system. \n\nTherefore,  Kiantone  failed  to  maintain  records  of  an  evaluation  of  the  capability  of  its  leak \ndetection, in accordance with § 195.452(l)(1). \n\nProposed Civil Penalty"
