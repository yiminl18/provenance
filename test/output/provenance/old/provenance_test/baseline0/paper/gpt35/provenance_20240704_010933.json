            "DISCUSSION \nOur revised model of personal informatics offers guidance and \ndesign  challenges  for  the  personal  informatics  community. \nSome  guidelines  are  consistent  with  those  suggested  by \nRooksby et al., including to consider the agency of people \nand how they want to self-track [34]. We supplement these \nguidelines  by  recommending  that  designers  plan  for  lapse \nand  resumption,  consider  people  migrating  between  tools, \nand support people adjusting their tracking goals.",
            "CONCLUSION \nWe  offer  a  model  of  personal  informatics  informed  by  the \nperspective  of  lived  informatics,  expanding  upon  prior \nmodels based primarily in behavior change and maintenance. \nWe identify three initial motivations for tracking: the desire \nto  change  behavior,  instrumenting  for  rewards  or  social \nengagement,  and  curiosity  regarding  data  and  habits. \nOur model captures the practices of self-trackers with such \ndiverse goals, offers a better understanding of how they use \nself-tracking  tools,  and  helps  surface  relatively  unexplored \nchallenges for future designers and researchers.",
            "While  this  rhetorical  positioning  comes  across  clearly  in\npersonal informatics, many papers in our review that were\nnot identified by the authors under that umbrella still cited\nsimilar  motivations.  For  example, Mathur  and  Karahalios\ndescribe  a  visualization  system  based  on  bookmarks  in  a\nweb  browser  wherein  “the  user  is  able  to  notice  things\nabout  oneself  that  he  or  she  did  not  notice  before”\n[65:4657].",

            "Interestingly,  although  reflection  plays  a  prominent  role  in\npersonal informatics and related work, the final stage of Li\net  al.’s  [55]  model,  and  the  goal  of  much  similar  work,  is\naction. Their line of reasoning suggests that showing users\ndata  about  themselves  will  lead  them  to do  something,\npresumably  something  different  from  and  better  than  what\nthey  are  already  doing.  For  example,  showing  diabetics\nblood sugar levels will increase their ability to manage their\ncondition  [25];  showing  frequency  of  shortcut  key  usage\nwill increase their usage [62]; showing mouse accuracy will\nreduce  exaggerated  movements  and  improve  future\nperformance  [44].  Indeed,  the  idea  of  inciting  behavioral\nchange occurred implicitly in much of the papers reviewed\nhere.  However,  these  papers  also  varied  in  the  degree  of\nprescribing  exactly  of  what  that  behavioral  change  should\nconsist, raising comparisons with persuasion."
