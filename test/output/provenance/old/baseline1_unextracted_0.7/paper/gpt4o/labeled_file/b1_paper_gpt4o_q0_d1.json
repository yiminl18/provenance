We  also  excluded  papers  that  were\nreflections on the field of HCI where the  authors were the\nprimary people doing the reflecting.

What definition of reflection does the paper offer?\n2. To what application domain does the paper pertain?\n3. Who  are  the  people  doing  the  reflecting  (e.g.,  system",

What are the stated benefits of reflection?\n\nThese questions were not meant to be restrictive, i.e., these\nwere not the only aspects of these papers in which we were\ninterested.  Rather,  they  were  meant  to  provide  generative\nguidance\u2014what patterns, trends, or themes might be noted\nby  attending  to  these  questions? After  formulating  our  list\nof  questions,  the  papers  were  evenly  divided  among  the\nauthors.

The  authors\nalso  met  periodically  throughout  the  reading  process  to\ndiscuss both observations and questions."
