A plurality of papers come from\nthe  ACM  SIGCHI  conference,  either  the  full  proceedings\n(13 papers) or the extended abstracts (16). The later include\na mix of workshop descriptions, works in progress, posters,\netc. The next largest contingent appears in the Creativity &\nCognition  conference  (8).
