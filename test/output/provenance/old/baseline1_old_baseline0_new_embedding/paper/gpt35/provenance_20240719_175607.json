        "Self-tracking and Personal Informatics Models \nPeople  use  a  myriad  of  self-tracking  tools  to  collect  and \nreflect  on  their  personal  information.  To  understand  how \npeople  use  these  tools  and  the  information  they  collect, \nLi et al.  developed  the  five-staged  personal  informatics \nmodel [29]:  preparation,  collection,  integration,  reflection, \nand  action.  They  later  expanded  the  reflection  stage  to \nmaintenance and discovery phases [30].",
        "Including Social Roles in Personal Informatics Models \nOur findings show that people’s interactions with others can \ntracking  behaviors.  Prior  research \ninfluence  personal \nestablished that others, such as health care providers [12,35] \nor family members [25,50], influence people’s tracking and \nhealth  decisions  and  can  help  them  maintain  their  health. \nInvolvement of others can offer accountability and guidance \non how to track as well as how to interpret and act on tracked \ndata. Although the importance of others in health behaviors \nand  in  self-tracking  decisions  is  well-established,  the \nmodels  the  HCI  community  uses  to  understand  and  design \nfor self-tracking tools [21,29] still focus on the individual.",
        "Rooksby et al. proposed “lived informatics” to describe the \nintertwined roles of self-tracking plays in people’s everyday \nlife  [49].  They  also  described  various  goals  people  have \nwhile  adopting  self-tracking  practices,  such  as  behavior \nchange, curiosity, or instrumental purposes (having a record, \nreceiving \nincentives,  and  maintaining  a  relationship). \nEpstein et al. later developed the lived informatics model [21] \nto  better  describe  people’s  tool  selection  choices,  the \nconcurrent  and  iterative  nature  of  collection,  integration, \nand  reflection,  as  well  as  the  lapse  or  resumption  of \ntracking.  The  lived  informatics  model  has  three  major \nstages:  (1)  Deciding  and  selecting:  In  this  stage,  people \nmake  decisions  about  tracking  and  choose  the  tools  they \nwant  to  use",
