            "Self-tracking and Personal Informatics Models \nPeople  use  a  myriad  of  self-tracking  tools  to  collect  and \nreflect  on  their  personal  information.  To  understand  how \npeople  use  these  tools  and  the  information  they  collect, \nLi et al.  developed  the  five-staged  personal  informatics \nmodel [29]:  preparation,  collection,  integration,  reflection, \nand  action.  They  later  expanded  the  reflection  stage  to \nmaintenance and discovery phases [30].",
            "Including Social Roles in Personal Informatics Models \nOur findings show that people\u2019s interactions with others can \ntracking  behaviors.  Prior  research \ninfluence  personal \nestablished that others, such as health care providers [12,35] \nor family members [25,50], influence people\u2019s tracking and \nhealth  decisions  and  can  help  them  maintain  their  health. \nInvolvement of others can offer accountability and guidance \non how to track as well as how to interpret and act on tracked \ndata. Although the importance of others in health behaviors \nand  in  self-tracking  decisions  is  well-established,  the \nmodels  the  HCI  community  uses  to  understand  and  design \nfor self-tracking tools [21,29] still focus on the individual.",
            "Designers  wanting  to  support  personal  tracking  in  social \ncontexts  should  consider  features  that  help  users  pursue \nsocial benefits. For example, systems can help users access \ncommunities \nfor  specific  health  goals  and  diverse \nexploration  as  well  as  providing  strategies  to  navigate \nthrough  different  communities.  Also,  systems  can  support \nusers in integrating information from different apps that are \nbetter fit to various aspects of their health goals. \n\nFor personal informatics researchers, the personal informatics \nmodels  should  be  further  developed  to  account  for  social \ninfluence.  Researchers  should  reflect  on  how  social  needs \naffect  people\u2019s  decisions  about  and  behavior  surrounding \nthe  acts  of  selecting  tools,  collecting,  integrating,  and \nreflecting on data, and lapsing and resuming.",
