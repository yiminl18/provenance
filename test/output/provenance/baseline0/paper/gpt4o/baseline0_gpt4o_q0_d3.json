            "To  date,  there  is  no  comprehensive  list  of  problems  that \nusers experience using these systems. Toward this end, we \nconducted  surveys  and  interviews  with  people  who  collect \nand reflect on personal information. From this, we derived a \nmodel of personal informatics systems organized by stages, \nwhich emphasizes the interdependence of the different parts \nof personal informatics systems.  \n\nWe  provide  three  main  contributions  in  this  paper:  1)  we \nidentify  problems  across  personal  informatics  tools,  2)  we \nintroduce and discuss a model that improves the diagnosis, \nin  personal \nassessment,  and  prediction  of  problems \ninformatics  systems,  and  3)  we  make  recommendations \nabout  how  to  improve  existing  systems  and  build  new  and \neffective personal informatics systems.  \n\nto",
