            "Interview Methods \nAfter completion of qualitative coding of the survey data, the \nfirst  two  authors  identified  questions  that  required  further \nin-depth  interviews  to  address.  Of Turkers who indicated in \nthe survey that they were willing to be contacted for interviews, \n36 respondents were identified as having representative tracking \nmotivations,  behaviors,  and  experiences  and  were  verbose  in \nresponses,  of  which  6  responded.  We  supplemented  these \ninterviews  with  another  16  recruited  through  university \nmailing lists and posts to social media. These interviewees \nwere screened for the same criteria as the Turkers."
