        "This  initial  search  generated  100  results.  Of  those,  we\nsought  papers  that  involved  studies  of  some  person  or\npersons  (often  users  though  not  always)  who  were\nreflecting.  We  excluded  papers  where  the  keyword\n“reflection”  was  used  to  refer  to  the  optical  phenomenon,\ne.g.,  “frustrated  total  internal  reflection”  as  a  technique  in\ntouch-based  interfaces. We  also  excluded  papers  that  were\nreflections on the field of HCI where the  authors were the\nprimary people doing the reflecting. This process resulted in\n76 papers being included in our review.\n\nReading and Analysis\nWe began our analysis by developing a series of questions\nintended  to  provide  a  sense  for  how  reflection  was\nconceptualized and deployed.\n\n1. What definition of reflection does the paper offer?\n2. To what application domain does the paper pertain?\n3. Who  are  the  people  doing  the  reflecting  (e.g.,  system",
        "users, designers, students, the elderly)?\nIs  reflection  the  desired  result  of  an  intervention\ndescribed  in  the  paper  (as  opposed  to,  say,  a  paper\nstudying reflection in some specific context)?\nIf  the  paper  describes  an  interactive  system,  what\n\n4.\n\n5.\n\ndesign  features  or  strategies  are  used  to  support\nreflection?\n\n6. What are the stated benefits of reflection?\n\nThese questions were not meant to be restrictive, i.e., these\nwere not the only aspects of these papers in which we were\ninterested.  Rather,  they  were  meant  to  provide  generative\nguidance—what patterns, trends, or themes might be noted\nby  attending  to  these  questions? After  formulating  our  list\nof  questions,  the  papers  were  evenly  divided  among  the\nauthors. Each author read her or his papers, both answering\nour  list  of  questions  and  noting  other  trends.  The  authors\nalso  met  periodically  throughout  the  reading  process  to\ndiscuss both observations and questions."
