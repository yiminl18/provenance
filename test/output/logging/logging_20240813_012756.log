Is  reflection  the  desired  result  of  an  intervention\ndescribed  in  the  paper  (as  opposed  to,  say,  a  paper\nstudying reflection in some specific context)?', 'If  the  paper  describes  an  interactive  system,  what\n\n4. 5.\n\ndesign  features  or  strategies  are  used  to  support\nreflection?', '6. What are the stated benefits of reflection? These questions were not meant to be restrictive, i.e., these\nwere not the only aspects of these papers in which we were\ninterested.', 'Rather,  they  were  meant  to  provide  generative\nguidance—what patterns, trends, or themes might be noted\nby  attending  to  these  questions?', 'After  formulating  our  list\nof  questions,  the  papers  were  evenly  divided  among  the\nauthors.', 'Each author read her or his papers, both answering\nour  list  of  questions  and  noting  other  trends.', 'The  authors\nalso  met  periodically  throughout  the  reading  process  to\ndiscuss both observations and questions.', '. The  papers  themselves  describe  a  variety  of  endeavors,\nincluding  interactive  systems  to  support  reflection  [e.g.,\n12], methods intended to incorporate reflection into design\nprocesses  [e.g., 19],  techniques  for  user  studies  [e.g.,\n39,40],  empirical  studies  of  reflective  practitioners  [e.g.,\n73,68], and others.']
