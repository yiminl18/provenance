facilitating decision making [20].

 All participants were told the same story: that the video was
customized to their mood and behavior data. After watching
the videos, participants ﬁlled out an evaluation form. There
were three questions that accepted free text-form responses,
without prompting the participants with any of the researcher’s
preconceptions such as "stress" or "social interaction":

• Q1 Ignoring imperfect AI renderings, what do you think

about the story in the video?

• Q2 What do you think about the main character (corgi dog)?

INTRODUCTION
The development of mobile phone technology and biological
sensors is enabling individuals to self-track biological, phys-
ical and environmental information. From rich self-tracking
data, individuals can interpret and infer the patterns, correla-
tions and causal relations in their own behavior and wellbeing.
Recent HCI research attempts to help users build up a critical
understanding of their data, especially to motivate users to
change their behaviors for the betterment of their own well-
being or their social, biological environment [26]. We often

 . The results indicated
that personalized animations tended to be more emotionally
engaging, encouraging greater and lengthier writing that indi-
cated self-reﬂection about moods and behaviors. Furthermore,
while human imagination plays an important and valuable part
in both conditions – test and control – the impact we found
suggests that true personalization may be more powerfully
inﬂuential on moods and self-reﬂection than simply believing
that one is receiving personalized feedback.
