 Interestingly,  although  reflection  plays  a  prominent  role  in
personal informatics and related work, the final stage of Li
et  al.’s  [55]  model,  and  the  goal  of  much  similar  work,  is
action. Their line of reasoning suggests that showing users
data  about  themselves  will  lead  them  to do  something,
presumably  something  different  from  and  better  than  what
they  are  already  doing.  For  example,  showing  diabetics
blood sugar levels will increase their ability to manage their
condition  [25];  showing  frequency  of  shortcut  key  usage
will increase their usage [62]; showing mouse accuracy will
reduce  exaggerated  movements  and  improve  future
performance  [44].  Indeed,  the  idea  of  inciting  behavioral
change occurred implicitly in much of the papers reviewed
here.  However,  these  papers  also  varied  in  the  degree  of
prescribing  exactly  of  what  that  behavioral  change  should
consist, raising comparisons with persuasion.

 While  this  rhetorical  positioning  comes  across  clearly  in
personal informatics, many papers in our review that were
not identified by the authors under that umbrella still cited
similar  motivations.  For  example, Mathur  and  Karahalios
describe  a  visualization  system  based  on  bookmarks  in  a
web  browser  wherein  “the  user  is  able  to  notice  things
about  oneself  that  he  or  she  did  not  notice  before”
[65:4657].
