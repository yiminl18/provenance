 Self-tracking and Personal Informatics Models 
People  use  a  myriad  of  self-tracking  tools  to  collect  and 
reflect  on  their  personal  information.  To  understand  how 
people  use  these  tools  and  the  information  they  collect, 
Li et al.  developed  the  five-staged  personal  informatics 
model [29]:  preparation,  collection,  integration,  reflection, 
and  action.  They  later  expanded  the  reflection  stage  to 
maintenance and discovery phases [30].

 Including Social Roles in Personal Informatics Models 
Our findings show that people’s interactions with others can 
tracking  behaviors.  Prior  research 
influence  personal 
established that others, such as health care providers [12,35] 
or family members [25,50], influence people’s tracking and 
health  decisions  and  can  help  them  maintain  their  health. 
Involvement of others can offer accountability and guidance 
on how to track as well as how to interpret and act on tracked 
data. Although the importance of others in health behaviors 
and  in  self-tracking  decisions  is  well-established,  the 
models  the  HCI  community  uses  to  understand  and  design 
for self-tracking tools [21,29] still focus on the individual.

 Designers  wanting  to  support  personal  tracking  in  social 
contexts  should  consider  features  that  help  users  pursue 
social benefits. For example, systems can help users access 
communities 
for  specific  health  goals  and  diverse 
exploration  as  well  as  providing  strategies  to  navigate 
through  different  communities.  Also,  systems  can  support 
users in integrating information from different apps that are 
better fit to various aspects of their health goals. 

For personal informatics researchers, the personal informatics 
models  should  be  further  developed  to  account  for  social 
influence.  Researchers  should  reflect  on  how  social  needs 
affect  people’s  decisions  about  and  behavior  surrounding 
the  acts  of  selecting  tools,  collecting,  integrating,  and 
reflecting on data, and lapsing and resuming.

 Rooksby et al. proposed “lived informatics” to describe the 
intertwined roles of self-tracking plays in people’s everyday 
life  [49].  They  also  described  various  goals  people  have 
while  adopting  self-tracking  practices,  such  as  behavior 
change, curiosity, or instrumental purposes (having a record, 
receiving 
incentives,  and  maintaining  a  relationship). 
Epstein et al. later developed the lived informatics model [21] 
to  better  describe  people’s  tool  selection  choices,  the 
concurrent  and  iterative  nature  of  collection,  integration, 
and  reflection,  as  well  as  the  lapse  or  resumption  of 
tracking.  The  lived  informatics  model  has  three  major 
stages:  (1)  Deciding  and  selecting:  In  this  stage,  people 
make  decisions  about  tracking  and  choose  the  tools  they 
want  to  use

 To  date,  there  is  no  comprehensive  list  of  problems  that 
users experience using these systems. Toward this end, we 
conducted  surveys  and  interviews  with  people  who  collect 
and reflect on personal information. From this, we derived a 
model of personal informatics systems organized by stages, 
which emphasizes the interdependence of the different parts 
of personal informatics systems.  

We  provide  three  main  contributions  in  this  paper:  1)  we 
identify  problems  across  personal  informatics  tools,  2)  we 
introduce and discuss a model that improves the diagnosis, 
in  personal 
assessment,  and  prediction  of  problems 
informatics  systems,  and  3)  we  make  recommendations 
about  how  to  improve  existing  systems  and  build  new  and 
effective personal informatics systems.

Cascading  barriers  suggest  that  a  holistic  approach  to  the 
design of personal informatics systems is critical. Focusing 
only on one stage ignores the whole experience of the user 
with  the  system.  While  we  can  take  inspiration  from 
different  fields  to  resolve  barriers  within  each  stage  (e.g., 
visualization  techniques  from  information  visualization 
research), creating an effective personal informatics system 
requires the consideration of all of the system's parts.

 A Definition of Personal Informatics 
Collecting  information  about  oneself  and  reflecting  on  the 
information  has  a  long  history.  Benjamin  Franklin  tracked 
the days in which he accomplished one of his 13 virtues for 
60  years  [5].  Buckminster  Fuller  documented  every  15 
minutes of his life in a scrapbook he called the “Dymaxion 
Chronofile”.  These  days,  there  are  people  like  Nicholas 
Felton,  who  has  been  publishing  annual  reports  about 
himself since 2005 (http://feltron.com), and Ellie Harrison, 
who  created  art  projects  on  her  personal  behavior,  such  as 
food  consumption  and  sneezes  (http://ellieharrison.com). 
These  are  extreme  examples,  but  regular  people  are 
tracking one or two types of personal information and using 
computing  technology  in  the  form  of  personal  informatics 
systems to do so.

 Personal informatics represents an interesting area of study 
in  human-computer  interaction.  First,  these  systems  help 
people  better  understand  their  behavior.  While  many 
technologies  inform  people  about  the  world,  personal 
informatics  systems 
themselves. 
Second,  people  participate  in  both  the  collection  of 
behavioral  information  as  well  as  the  exploration  and 
understanding  of  the  information.  This  poses  demands  on 
users that need to be explored. Finally, we do not know all 
the  problems  that  people  may  experience  with  personal 
informatics  systems.  We  know  that  people  want  to  get 
information about themselves to reflect on, and that systems 
that support this activity need to be effective and simple to 
use.  Identifying  problems 
in 
collecting and making sense of personal information while 
using such systems is critical for designing and developing 
effective personal informatics.

INTRODUCTION
The development of mobile phone technology and biological
sensors is enabling individuals to self-track biological, phys-
ical and environmental information. From rich self-tracking
data, individuals can interpret and infer the patterns, correla-
tions and causal relations in their own behavior and wellbeing.
Recent HCI research attempts to help users build up a critical
understanding of their data, especially to motivate users to
change their behaviors for the betterment of their own well-
being or their social, biological environment [26]. We often

 . The results indicated
that personalized animations tended to be more emotionally
engaging, encouraging greater and lengthier writing that indi-
cated self-reﬂection about moods and behaviors. Furthermore,
while human imagination plays an important and valuable part
in both conditions – test and control – the impact we found
suggests that true personalization may be more powerfully
inﬂuential on moods and self-reﬂection than simply believing
that one is receiving personalized feedback.

OAB  is  a  treatable  condition  as \n70%  of  people  can  be  cured  or  have  their  symptoms \nameliorated  [1].  However,  it  remains  undertreated  due  to \npeople not seeking treatment, lack of proactive questioning \nby physicians and embarrassment [1]. Moreover, traditional \ntreatment requires  motivation  and  involvement, leading to \na  drop  out  whenever  results  are  not  quickly  seen  [10,  56]. \nSmartphones  are  popular  ubiquitous  devices,  with  78%  of \nUK  adults  using  one  [53].
