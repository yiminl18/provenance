 After reading all the papers in our corpus, we conducted an
analysis  based  on  a  grounded  theory  approach  [27].
Combining  our  answers  to  the  above  questions  with  other
notes  and  observations,  we  developed  a  list  of  salient
themes emerging from our discussions of the papers. These
themes became the  basis for  a  series  of  memos,  with each
memo both describing one theme or pattern and indicating
the reason for its interest or significance. The memos were
then  circulated  among  the  authors,  who  discussed  them
further,  refined  them,  and  considered  relationships  among
them. These memos, and the themes they describe, form the
basis for the following sections.

 .  Of  those  28  papers  that  did  cite  a  reference  for
reflection,  a  large  majority  (20)  drew  on  Schön’s  [76]
concept  of  reflection-in-action.  The  remainder  cite  work
from a variety of areas, such as creativity [100].

 This  initial  search  generated  100  results.  Of  those,  we
sought  papers  that  involved  studies  of  some  person  or
persons  (often  users  though  not  always)  who  were
reflecting.  We  excluded  papers  where  the  keyword
“reflection”  was  used  to  refer  to  the  optical  phenomenon,
e.g.,  “frustrated  total  internal  reflection”  as  a  technique  in
touch-based  interfaces. We  also  excluded  papers  that  were
reflections on the field of HCI where the  authors were the
primary people doing the reflecting. This process resulted in
76 papers being included in our review.

Reading and Analysis
We began our analysis by developing a series of questions
intended  to  provide  a  sense  for  how  reflection  was
conceptualized and deployed.

1. What definition of reflection does the paper offer?
2. To what application domain does the paper pertain?
3. Who  are  the  people  doing  the  reflecting  (e.g.,  system

 users, designers, students, the elderly)?
Is  reflection  the  desired  result  of  an  intervention
described  in  the  paper  (as  opposed  to,  say,  a  paper
studying reflection in some specific context)?
If  the  paper  describes  an  interactive  system,  what

design  features  or  strategies  are  used  to  support
reflection?

6. What are the stated benefits of reflection?

These questions were not meant to be restrictive, i.e., these
were not the only aspects of these papers in which we were
interested.  Rather,  they  were  meant  to  provide  generative
guidance—what patterns, trends, or themes might be noted
by  attending  to  these  questions? After  formulating  our  list
of  questions,  the  papers  were  evenly  divided  among  the
authors. Each author read her or his papers, both answering
our  list  of  questions  and  noting  other  trends.  The  authors
also  met  periodically  throughout  the  reading  process  to
discuss both observations and questions.
