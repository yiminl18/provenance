Cascading  barriers  suggest  that  a  holistic  approach  to  the 
design of personal informatics systems is critical. Focusing 
only on one stage ignores the whole experience of the user 
with  the  system.  While  we  can  take  inspiration  from 
different  fields  to  resolve  barriers  within  each  stage  (e.g., 
visualization  techniques  from  information  visualization 
research), creating an effective personal informatics system 
requires the consideration of all of the system's parts.

 A Definition of Personal Informatics 
Collecting  information  about  oneself  and  reflecting  on  the 
information  has  a  long  history.  Benjamin  Franklin  tracked 
the days in which he accomplished one of his 13 virtues for 
60  years  [5].  Buckminster  Fuller  documented  every  15 
minutes of his life in a scrapbook he called the “Dymaxion 
Chronofile”.  These  days,  there  are  people  like  Nicholas 
Felton,  who  has  been  publishing  annual  reports  about 
himself since 2005 (http://feltron.com), and Ellie Harrison, 
who  created  art  projects  on  her  personal  behavior,  such  as 
food  consumption  and  sneezes  (http://ellieharrison.com). 
These  are  extreme  examples,  but  regular  people  are 
tracking one or two types of personal information and using 
computing  technology  in  the  form  of  personal  informatics 
systems to do so.

 Personal informatics represents an interesting area of study 
in  human-computer  interaction.  First,  these  systems  help 
people  better  understand  their  behavior.  While  many 
technologies  inform  people  about  the  world,  personal 
informatics  systems 
themselves. 
Second,  people  participate  in  both  the  collection  of 
behavioral  information  as  well  as  the  exploration  and 
understanding  of  the  information.  This  poses  demands  on 
users that need to be explored. Finally, we do not know all 
the  problems  that  people  may  experience  with  personal 
informatics  systems.  We  know  that  people  want  to  get 
information about themselves to reflect on, and that systems 
that support this activity need to be effective and simple to 
use.  Identifying  problems 
in 
collecting and making sense of personal information while 
using such systems is critical for designing and developing 
effective personal informatics.

 All participants were told the same story: that the video was
customized to their mood and behavior data. After watching
the videos, participants ﬁlled out an evaluation form. There
were three questions that accepted free text-form responses,
without prompting the participants with any of the researcher’s
preconceptions such as "stress" or "social interaction":

• Q1 Ignoring imperfect AI renderings, what do you think

about the story in the video?

• Q2 What do you think about the main character (corgi dog)?

INTRODUCTION
The development of mobile phone technology and biological
sensors is enabling individuals to self-track biological, phys-
ical and environmental information. From rich self-tracking
data, individuals can interpret and infer the patterns, correla-
tions and causal relations in their own behavior and wellbeing.
Recent HCI research attempts to help users build up a critical
understanding of their data, especially to motivate users to
change their behaviors for the betterment of their own well-
being or their social, biological environment [26]. We often

 . The results indicated
that personalized animations tended to be more emotionally
engaging, encouraging greater and lengthier writing that indi-
cated self-reﬂection about moods and behaviors. Furthermore,
while human imagination plays an important and valuable part
in both conditions – test and control – the impact we found
suggests that true personalization may be more powerfully
inﬂuential on moods and self-reﬂection than simply believing
that one is receiving personalized feedback.

However,  it  remains  undertreated  due  to \npeople not seeking treatment, lack of proactive questioning \nby physicians and embarrassment [1]. Moreover, traditional \ntreatment requires  motivation  and  involvement, leading to \na  drop  out  whenever  results  are  not  quickly  seen  [10,  56]. \nSmartphones  are  popular  ubiquitous  devices,  with  78%  of \nUK  adults  using  one  [53].

Our results show that these findings could also hold for \nembarrassing conditions. Previous research [45, 37] showed \nthe  importance  of  progress  and  positive  feedback,  such  as \nscores  or  badges  to  help  people  adhere  to  treatment. \nHowever, although linked, the two are usually displayed on \nseparate  screens.  Our  results  show  that  combining  happy \nicons  (the  user  reached  their  voids  goal)  and  displaying \nthem directly  within  the progress  screen (number  of  voids \nin the past week) motivates people. Therefore, mHealth app \ndesigners could consider bringing together the progress and \nthe goals onto the same screen.  \n\nConfirming  other  literature  findings  [38,  14],  our  data \nshowed  that reminders helped  our UPs  with their exercise \nregime and in consuming proper amount of liquid per day.', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/extracted_data/A Wee Bit More Interaction: Designing and Evaluating an Overactive Bladder App.txt', 'start_index': 56346, 'chunk_index': 84}), Document(page_content='CHI 2019 Paper  CHI 2019, May 4–9, 2019, Glasgow, Scotland, UKPaper 703Page 11 \n \n \n \n\x0cAlthough  in  previous  research  reminders  were  focusing \nonly  in  one  area  (e.g.,  exercise  adherence  [38],  or  lifestyle \nchanges  [14]),  we  show  that  having  more  than  one \nreminder type is not annoying and could encourage people \nwith  their  self-managed  treatment.  Therefore,  designers \nmay consider using more than one reminder type.  \n\nDuring  Study  1,  it  was  suggested  to  us  to  include  a \ntreatment  outline.  This  feature  met  with  high  approval \nduring  Study  2  and  had  a  high  number  of  accesses  during \nStudy  3.  Moreover,  given  the  fact  that  UPs  stated  the  app \nmade them more aware of their exercises and fluid intake, it \ncan  be  concluded  that  the  app  also  has  the  potential  of \nincreasing awareness of OAB symptoms. \n\nRQ3:  Does context have an impact on how users engage with \nthe app?', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/extracted_data/A Wee Bit More Interaction: Designing and Evaluating an Overactive Bladder App.txt', 'start_index': 57323, 'chunk_index': 85}), Document(page_content='As  suggested  in  the  literature  [6,  47],  both  lab  and  field \nstudies  are  needed  to  properly  evaluate  the  usability  of  a \nmobile  phone  app.  Our  data  validate  this  finding  as  we \ndiscovered  design  issues  with  some  features  (e.g.,  bladder \ndiary,  location  map,  and  games)  that  were  not  highlighted \nduring  the  first  two  studies.
