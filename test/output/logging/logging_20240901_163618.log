 Models of Personal Informatics 
Li et al. develop a stage-based model of personal informatics 
systems  and  describe  barriers  people  face  in  each  stage 
(Figure 1) [21]. The model has five stages: 1) preparation, or 
starting to collect data and thinking about what information 
to  record  and  how  to  collect  it;  2)  collection,  or  gathering 
data;  3)  integration,  or  preparing  data  to  reflect  upon; 
4) reflection, or examining and exploring data; and 5) action, 
or  taking  one’s  newfound  understanding  of  themselves  to 
inform changes. Motivated by the Transtheoretical Model of 
Behavior  Change  (TTM)  [32],  Li  et  al.  later  identify  two 
phases  of  reflection,  discovery  and  maintenance,  and  note 
people ask different types of questions in each phase [22].

 DISCUSSION 
Our revised model of personal informatics offers guidance and 
design  challenges  for  the  personal  informatics  community. 
Some  guidelines  are  consistent  with  those  suggested  by 
Rooksby et al., including to consider the agency of people 
and how they want to self-track [34]. We supplement these 
guidelines  by  recommending  that  designers  plan  for  lapse 
and  resumption,  consider  people  migrating  between  tools, 
and support people adjusting their tracking goals.

 ABSTRACT 
Current  models  of  how  people  use  personal  informatics 
systems are largely based in behavior change goals. They do 
not  adequately  characterize  the  integration  of  self-tracking 
into  everyday  life  by  people  with  varying  goals.  We  build 
upon  prior  work  by  embracing  the  perspective  of  lived 
informatics to propose a new model of personal informatics. 
We examine how lived informatics manifests in the habits of 
self-trackers across a variety of domains, first by surveying 
105, 99, and 83 past and present trackers of physical activity, 
finances, and location and then by interviewing 22 trackers 
regarding their lived informatics experiences. We develop a 
model characterizing tracker processes of deciding to track 
and selecting a tool, elaborate on tool usage during collection, 
integration,  and  reflection  as  components  of  tracking  and 
acting,  and  discuss  the  lapsing  and  potential  resuming  of 
tracking

 INTRODUCTION 
Personal informatics, or collecting and reflecting on personal 
information,  has  become  increasingly  prevalent.  Personal 
informatics can serve a goal-driven purpose, such as tracking 
weight loss, increasing physical activity, having a record of 
places  visited,  or  tracking  student  loan  payments.  Beyond 
these goal-driven motivations, self-tracking tools are now a 
part  of  everyday  life,  or  “lived  informatics”,  with  people 
tracking out of curiosity or a fascination with numbers [34]. 
The pervasiveness of self-tracking tools has led researchers 
to  study  people’s  use  of  commercial  tools  for  tracking 
location  [24,30],  finances  [20],  food  [11],  weight  [19,25], 
and  physical  activity  [16,34]  and  to  develop  research 
prototypes to expand our understanding of usage [3,8,12,40].

 After reading all the papers in our corpus, we conducted an
analysis  based  on  a  grounded  theory  approach  [27].
Combining  our  answers  to  the  above  questions  with  other
notes  and  observations,  we  developed  a  list  of  salient
themes emerging from our discussions of the papers. These
themes became the  basis for  a  series  of  memos,  with each
memo both describing one theme or pattern and indicating
the reason for its interest or significance. The memos were
then  circulated  among  the  authors,  who  discussed  them
further,  refined  them,  and  considered  relationships  among
them. These memos, and the themes they describe, form the
basis for the following sections.

 RESULTS – THEMES AND PATTERNS
In  total,  our  corpus  included  76  papers,  all  published
between 2000 and 2013. The average publication year was
2010 and the median 2011. A plurality of papers come from
the  ACM  SIGCHI  conference,  either  the  full  proceedings
(13 papers) or the extended abstracts (16). The later include
a mix of workshop descriptions, works in progress, posters,
etc. The next largest contingent appears in the Creativity &
Cognition  conference  (8).  The  remainder  occurred  in  such
venues  as  Designing  Interactive  Systems  (3),  Artificial
Intelligence  and  Education  (3),  iConference  (2),  Tangible
and  Embedded  Computing  (2),  and  other  similar  venues

 .  Of  those  28  papers  that  did  cite  a  reference  for
reflection,  a  large  majority  (20)  drew  on  Schön’s  [76]
concept  of  reflection-in-action.  The  remainder  cite  work
from a variety of areas, such as creativity [100].

 This  initial  search  generated  100  results.  Of  those,  we
sought  papers  that  involved  studies  of  some  person  or
persons  (often  users  though  not  always)  who  were
reflecting.  We  excluded  papers  where  the  keyword
“reflection”  was  used  to  refer  to  the  optical  phenomenon,
e.g.,  “frustrated  total  internal  reflection”  as  a  technique  in
touch-based  interfaces. We  also  excluded  papers  that  were
reflections on the field of HCI where the  authors were the
primary people doing the reflecting. This process resulted in
76 papers being included in our review.

Reading and Analysis
We began our analysis by developing a series of questions
intended  to  provide  a  sense  for  how  reflection  was
conceptualized and deployed.

1. What definition of reflection does the paper offer?
2. To what application domain does the paper pertain?
3. Who  are  the  people  doing  the  reflecting  (e.g.,  system

personal informatics, many papers in our review that were

6. What are the stated benefits of reflection?

These questions were not meant to be restrictive, i.e., these
were not the only aspects of these papers in which we were
interested.  Rather,  they  were  meant  to  provide  generative
guidance—what patterns, trends, or themes might be noted
by  attending  to  these  questions? After  formulating  our  list
of  questions,  the  papers  were  evenly  divided  among  the
authors. Each author read her or his papers, both answering
our  list  of  questions  and  noting  other  trends.  The  authors
also  met  periodically  throughout  the  reading  process  to
discuss both observations and questions.

 Interestingly,  although  reflection  plays  a  prominent  role  in
personal informatics and related work, the final stage of Li
et  al.’s  [55]  model,  and  the  goal  of  much  similar  work,  is
action. Their line of reasoning suggests that showing users
data  about  themselves  will  lead  them  to do  something,
presumably  something  different  from  and  better  than  what
they  are  already  doing.  For  example,  showing  diabetics
blood sugar levels will increase their ability to manage their
condition  [25];  showing  frequency  of  shortcut  key  usage
will increase their usage [62]; showing mouse accuracy will
reduce  exaggerated  movements  and  improve  future
performance  [44].  Indeed,  the  idea  of  inciting  behavioral
change occurred implicitly in much of the papers reviewed
here.  However,  these  papers  also  varied  in  the  degree  of
prescribing  exactly  of  what  that  behavioral  change  should
consist, raising comparisons with persuasion.

 The Constitution of Reflection
Many  of  the  papers  in  this  review  described  interventions
designed  to  support  or  encourage  reflection  in  some  way.
However, the lack of definition or deeper engagement with
the  concept  of  reflection  poses  challenges  for  design.  For
example,  what  does  it  take  to  reflect?  How  can
interventions  provide  spaces  that  are  conducive  to
reflection?  As  mentioned  above,  the  Personal  Informatics
model  described  reflection as “looking at lists  of  collected
personal  information  or  exploring  or  interacting  with
information  visualizations,”  [55:562].  This  definition
carries  an  implicit  assumption  that  by  providing  access  to
data  that  has  been  “prepared,  combined,  and  transformed”
[55:561] for the purpose of reflection, reflection will occur.

 Self-tracking and Personal Informatics Models 
People  use  a  myriad  of  self-tracking  tools  to  collect  and 
reflect  on  their  personal  information.  To  understand  how 
people  use  these  tools  and  the  information  they  collect, 
Li et al.  developed  the  five-staged  personal  informatics 
model [29]:  preparation,  collection,  integration,  reflection, 
and  action.  They  later  expanded  the  reflection  stage  to 
maintenance and discovery phases [30].

 Including Social Roles in Personal Informatics Models 
Our findings show that people’s interactions with others can 
tracking  behaviors.  Prior  research 
influence  personal 
established that others, such as health care providers [12,35] 
or family members [25,50], influence people’s tracking and 
health  decisions  and  can  help  them  maintain  their  health. 
Involvement of others can offer accountability and guidance 
on how to track as well as how to interpret and act on tracked 
data. Although the importance of others in health behaviors 
and  in  self-tracking  decisions  is  well-established,  the 
models  the  HCI  community  uses  to  understand  and  design 
for self-tracking tools [21,29] still focus on the individual.

 Designers  wanting  to  support  personal  tracking  in  social 
contexts  should  consider  features  that  help  users  pursue 
social benefits. For example, systems can help users access 
communities 
for  specific  health  goals  and  diverse 
exploration  as  well  as  providing  strategies  to  navigate 
through  different  communities.  Also,  systems  can  support 
users in integrating information from different apps that are 
better fit to various aspects of their health goals. 

For personal informatics researchers, the personal informatics 
models  should  be  further  developed  to  account  for  social 
influence.  Researchers  should  reflect  on  how  social  needs 
affect  people’s  decisions  about  and  behavior  surrounding 
the  acts  of  selecting  tools,  collecting,  integrating,  and 
reflecting on data, and lapsing and resuming.

 Rooksby et al. proposed “lived informatics” to describe the 
intertwined roles of self-tracking plays in people’s everyday 
life  [49].  They  also  described  various  goals  people  have 
while  adopting  self-tracking  practices,  such  as  behavior 
change, curiosity, or instrumental purposes (having a record, 
receiving 
incentives,  and  maintaining  a  relationship). 
Epstein et al. later developed the lived informatics model [21] 
to  better  describe  people’s  tool  selection  choices,  the 
concurrent  and  iterative  nature  of  collection,  integration, 
and  reflection,  as  well  as  the  lapse  or  resumption  of 
tracking.  The  lived  informatics  model  has  three  major 
stages:  (1)  Deciding  and  selecting:  In  this  stage,  people 
make  decisions  about  tracking  and  choose  the  tools  they 
want  to  use

 To  date,  there  is  no  comprehensive  list  of  problems  that 
users experience using these systems. Toward this end, we 
conducted  surveys  and  interviews  with  people  who  collect 
and reflect on personal information. From this, we derived a 
model of personal informatics systems organized by stages, 
which emphasizes the interdependence of the different parts 
of personal informatics systems.  

We  provide  three  main  contributions  in  this  paper:  1)  we 
identify  problems  across  personal  informatics  tools,  2)  we 
introduce and discuss a model that improves the diagnosis, 
in  personal 
assessment,  and  prediction  of  problems 
informatics  systems,  and  3)  we  make  recommendations 
about  how  to  improve  existing  systems  and  build  new  and 
effective personal informatics systems.

Cascading  barriers  suggest  that  a  holistic  approach  to  the 
design of personal informatics systems is critical. Focusing 
only on one stage ignores the whole experience of the user 
with  the  system.  While  we  can  take  inspiration  from 
different  fields  to  resolve  barriers  within  each  stage  (e.g., 
visualization  techniques  from  information  visualization 
research), creating an effective personal informatics system 
requires the consideration of all of the system's parts.

 A Definition of Personal Informatics 
Collecting  information  about  oneself  and  reflecting  on  the 
information  has  a  long  history.  Benjamin  Franklin  tracked 
the days in which he accomplished one of his 13 virtues for 
60  years  [5].  Buckminster  Fuller  documented  every  15 
minutes of his life in a scrapbook he called the “Dymaxion 
Chronofile”.  These  days,  there  are  people  like  Nicholas 
Felton,  who  has  been  publishing  annual  reports  about 
himself since 2005 (http://feltron.com), and Ellie Harrison, 
who  created  art  projects  on  her  personal  behavior,  such  as 
food  consumption  and  sneezes  (http://ellieharrison.com). 
These  are  extreme  examples,  but  regular  people  are 
tracking one or two types of personal information and using 
computing  technology  in  the  form  of  personal  informatics 
systems to do so.

 Personal informatics represents an interesting area of study 
in  human-computer  interaction.  First,  these  systems  help 
people  better  understand  their  behavior.  While  many 
technologies  inform  people  about  the  world,  personal 
informatics  systems 
themselves. 
Second,  people  participate  in  both  the  collection  of 
behavioral  information  as  well  as  the  exploration  and 
understanding  of  the  information.  This  poses  demands  on 
users that need to be explored. Finally, we do not know all 
the  problems  that  people  may  experience  with  personal 
informatics  systems.  We  know  that  people  want  to  get 
information about themselves to reflect on, and that systems 
that support this activity need to be effective and simple to 
use.  Identifying  problems 
in 
collecting and making sense of personal information while 
using such systems is critical for designing and developing 
effective personal informatics.

Objective signals measured over the\ncourse of a day, including physical activity and sleep activity\nas well, can be combined with written responses to provide a\nmore complete affective-cognitive-physical state assessment.', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/extracted_data/A Trip to the Moon: Personalized Animated Movies for Self-reflection.txt', 'start_index': 46436, 'chunk_index': 64}), Document(page_content='CONCLUSION\nConverting personal data into a format that can have emotional\nimpact can potentially fuel motivation for self-reﬂection and\npositive behavior change; however, a fully-automated system\nis not capable today of understanding human personal expe-\nriences at the kind of level that could make such a story both\nexplicit and accurate. To solve this challenge, we built an au-\ntomated system to construct an animation that is personalized\nto the data provided by an individual over a week, utilizing\nan animated avatar (corgi) that implicitly reﬂects the person’s\nbehaviors, such as sleep and social interactions, and moods\nassociated with each day of the week. We conducted two stud-\nies: The ﬁrst found that the avatar’s portrayal of a set of moods\nand behaviors could be perceived accurately in general. The\nsecond study tested the emotional engagement of using a per-\nsonalized story against a challenging control: a similar story\nthat they were told was personalized', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/extracted_data/A Trip to the Moon: Personalized Animated Movies for Self-reflection.txt', 'start_index': 46661, 'chunk_index': 65}), Document(page_content='. The results indicated\nthat personalized animations tended to be more emotionally\nengaging, encouraging greater and lengthier writing that indi-\ncated self-reﬂection about moods and behaviors. Furthermore,\nwhile human imagination plays an important and valuable part\nin both conditions – test and control – the impact we found\nsuggests that true personalization may be more powerfully\ninﬂuential on moods and self-reﬂection than simply believing\nthat one is receiving personalized feedback.', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/extracted_data/A Trip to the Moon: Personalized Animated Movies for Self-reflection.txt', 'start_index': 47637, 'chunk_index': 66}), Document(page_content='ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThis research was partially supported by the Advancing Well-\nbeing Initiative at the MIT Media Lab.

INTRODUCTION
The development of mobile phone technology and biological
sensors is enabling individuals to self-track biological, phys-
ical and environmental information. From rich self-tracking
data, individuals can interpret and infer the patterns, correla-
tions and causal relations in their own behavior and wellbeing.
Recent HCI research attempts to help users build up a critical
understanding of their data, especially to motivate users to
change their behaviors for the betterment of their own well-
being or their social, biological environment [26]. We often

 . The results indicated
that personalized animations tended to be more emotionally
engaging, encouraging greater and lengthier writing that indi-
cated self-reﬂection about moods and behaviors. Furthermore,
while human imagination plays an important and valuable part
in both conditions – test and control – the impact we found
suggests that true personalization may be more powerfully
inﬂuential on moods and self-reﬂection than simply believing
that one is receiving personalized feedback.

OAB  is  a  treatable  condition  as \n70%  of  people  can  be  cured  or  have  their  symptoms \nameliorated  [1].  However,  it  remains  undertreated  due  to \npeople not seeking treatment, lack of proactive questioning \nby physicians and embarrassment [1]. Moreover, traditional \ntreatment requires  motivation  and  involvement, leading to \na  drop  out  whenever  results  are  not  quickly  seen  [10,  56]. \nSmartphones  are  popular  ubiquitous  devices,  with  78%  of \nUK  adults  using  one  [53].
