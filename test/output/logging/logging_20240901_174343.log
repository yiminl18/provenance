 A Definition of Personal Informatics 
Collecting  information  about  oneself  and  reflecting  on  the 
information  has  a  long  history.  Benjamin  Franklin  tracked 
the days in which he accomplished one of his 13 virtues for 
60  years  [5].  Buckminster  Fuller  documented  every  15 
minutes of his life in a scrapbook he called the “Dymaxion 
Chronofile”.  These  days,  there  are  people  like  Nicholas 
Felton,  who  has  been  publishing  annual  reports  about 
himself since 2005 (http://feltron.com), and Ellie Harrison, 
who  created  art  projects  on  her  personal  behavior,  such  as 
food  consumption  and  sneezes  (http://ellieharrison.com). 
These  are  extreme  examples,  but  regular  people  are 
tracking one or two types of personal information and using 
computing  technology  in  the  form  of  personal  informatics 
systems to do so.

 In  the  next  section,  we  provide  a  working  definition  of 
personal  informatics  and  review  related  literature.  We 
present  the  method  and  findings  from  our  survey,  and  use 
them 
introduce  a  stage-based  model  of  personal 
informatics  systems.  We  describe  the  barriers  encountered 
in  each  stage  and  highlight  opportunities  for  intervention 
within  each  stage.  We  also  compare  and  analyze  existing 
systems to demonstrate the use of the model for diagnosing

and  assessing  problems.  We  conclude  with  a  discussion  of 
design  guidelines  for  personal  informatics  systems  and 
directions for future research.

We believe the model and its properties will be valuable for 
future  research  and  development  because  it  provides  a 
for  describing,  comparing,  and 
common 
evaluating 
systems.  Personal

informatics  systems  pose  new  interesting  HCI  challenges. 
We believe that the stage-based model, the identification of 
the  barriers  within  each  stage,  and  the  description  of  the 
properties  of  the  stages  will  help  HCI  researchers  and 
practitioners  find  solutions  and  explore  new  approaches  in 
personal informatics more efficiently.

 Personal informatics represents an interesting area of study 
in  human-computer  interaction.  First,  these  systems  help 
people  better  understand  their  behavior.  While  many 
technologies  inform  people  about  the  world,  personal 
informatics  systems 
themselves. 
Second,  people  participate  in  both  the  collection  of 
behavioral  information  as  well  as  the  exploration  and 
understanding  of  the  information.  This  poses  demands  on 
users that need to be explored. Finally, we do not know all 
the  problems  that  people  may  experience  with  personal 
informatics  systems.  We  know  that  people  want  to  get 
information about themselves to reflect on, and that systems 
that support this activity need to be effective and simple to 
use.  Identifying  problems 
in 
collecting and making sense of personal information while 
using such systems is critical for designing and developing 
effective personal informatics.
