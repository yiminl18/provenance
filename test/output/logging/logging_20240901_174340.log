Cascading  barriers  suggest  that  a  holistic  approach  to  the 
design of personal informatics systems is critical. Focusing 
only on one stage ignores the whole experience of the user 
with  the  system.  While  we  can  take  inspiration  from 
different  fields  to  resolve  barriers  within  each  stage  (e.g., 
visualization  techniques  from  information  visualization 
research), creating an effective personal informatics system 
requires the consideration of all of the system's parts.

 In  the  next  section,  we  provide  a  working  definition  of 
personal  informatics  and  review  related  literature.  We 
present  the  method  and  findings  from  our  survey,  and  use 
them 
introduce  a  stage-based  model  of  personal 
informatics  systems.  We  describe  the  barriers  encountered 
in  each  stage  and  highlight  opportunities  for  intervention 
within  each  stage.  We  also  compare  and  analyze  existing 
systems to demonstrate the use of the model for diagnosing

and  assessing  problems.  We  conclude  with  a  discussion  of 
design  guidelines  for  personal  informatics  systems  and 
directions for future research.
