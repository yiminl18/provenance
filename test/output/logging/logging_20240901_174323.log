 While  this  rhetorical  positioning  comes  across  clearly  in
personal informatics, many papers in our review that were
not identified by the authors under that umbrella still cited
similar  motivations.  For  example, Mathur  and  Karahalios
describe  a  visualization  system  based  on  bookmarks  in  a
web  browser  wherein  “the  user  is  able  to  notice  things
about  oneself  that  he  or  she  did  not  notice  before”
[65:4657].

 After reading all the papers in our corpus, we conducted an
analysis  based  on  a  grounded  theory  approach  [27].
Combining  our  answers  to  the  above  questions  with  other
notes  and  observations,  we  developed  a  list  of  salient
themes emerging from our discussions of the papers. These
themes became the  basis for  a  series  of  memos,  with each
memo both describing one theme or pattern and indicating
the reason for its interest or significance. The memos were
then  circulated  among  the  authors,  who  discussed  them
further,  refined  them,  and  considered  relationships  among
them. These memos, and the themes they describe, form the
basis for the following sections.

 DISCUSSION
This  section  turns  from  describing  what  we  found  during
our  literature  review  to  considering  the  implications  of
these  patterns,  as  well  as  what  they  suggest  as  valuable
directions for future work in this area.
