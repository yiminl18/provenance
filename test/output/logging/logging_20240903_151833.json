    "total_token_num": 492,
    "evidence": [
        "The model has five stages: 1) preparation, or \nstarting to collect data and thinking about what information \nto  record  and  how  to  collect  it;  2)  collection,  or  gathering \ndata;  3)  integration,  or  preparing  data  to  reflect  upon; \n4) reflection, or examining and exploring data; and 5) action, \nor  taking  one’s  newfound  understanding  of  themselves  to \ninform changes.",
        "Some  guidelines  are  consistent  with  those  suggested  by \nRooksby et al., including to consider the agency of people \nand how they want to self-track [34].",
        "We supplement these \nguidelines  by  recommending  that  designers  plan  for  lapse \nand  resumption,  consider  people  migrating  between  tools, \nand support people adjusting their tracking goals.",
        "Beyond \nthese goal-driven motivations, self-tracking tools are now a \npart  of  everyday  life,  or  “lived  informatics”,  with  people \ntracking out of curiosity or a fascination with numbers [34]."
