 Self-tracking and Personal Informatics Models 
People  use  a  myriad  of  self-tracking  tools  to  collect  and 
reflect  on  their  personal  information.  To  understand  how 
people  use  these  tools  and  the  information  they  collect, 
Li et al.  developed  the  five-staged  personal  informatics 
model [29]:  preparation,  collection,  integration,  reflection, 
and  action.  They  later  expanded  the  reflection  stage  to 
maintenance and discovery phases [30].

 Including Social Roles in Personal Informatics Models 
Our findings show that people’s interactions with others can 
tracking  behaviors.  Prior  research 
influence  personal 
established that others, such as health care providers [12,35] 
or family members [25,50], influence people’s tracking and 
health  decisions  and  can  help  them  maintain  their  health. 
Involvement of others can offer accountability and guidance 
on how to track as well as how to interpret and act on tracked 
data. Although the importance of others in health behaviors 
and  in  self-tracking  decisions  is  well-established,  the 
models  the  HCI  community  uses  to  understand  and  design 
for self-tracking tools [21,29] still focus on the individual.

 Designers  wanting  to  support  personal  tracking  in  social 
contexts  should  consider  features  that  help  users  pursue 
social benefits. For example, systems can help users access 
communities 
for  specific  health  goals  and  diverse 
exploration  as  well  as  providing  strategies  to  navigate 
through  different  communities.  Also,  systems  can  support 
users in integrating information from different apps that are 
better fit to various aspects of their health goals. 

For personal informatics researchers, the personal informatics 
models  should  be  further  developed  to  account  for  social 
influence.  Researchers  should  reflect  on  how  social  needs 
affect  people’s  decisions  about  and  behavior  surrounding 
the  acts  of  selecting  tools,  collecting,  integrating,  and 
reflecting on data, and lapsing and resuming.

 Rooksby et al. proposed “lived informatics” to describe the 
intertwined roles of self-tracking plays in people’s everyday 
life  [49].  They  also  described  various  goals  people  have 
while  adopting  self-tracking  practices,  such  as  behavior 
change, curiosity, or instrumental purposes (having a record, 
receiving 
incentives,  and  maintaining  a  relationship). 
Epstein et al. later developed the lived informatics model [21] 
to  better  describe  people’s  tool  selection  choices,  the 
concurrent  and  iterative  nature  of  collection,  integration, 
and  reflection,  as  well  as  the  lapse  or  resumption  of 
tracking.  The  lived  informatics  model  has  three  major 
stages:  (1)  Deciding  and  selecting:  In  this  stage,  people 
make  decisions  about  tracking  and  choose  the  tools  they 
want  to  use
