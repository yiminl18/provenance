releasing 353 barrels (bbls) of unleaded gasoline into a marsh in Linden, New Jersey.

 During the investigation, PHMSA requested ILI records for the 2019 and 2014 runs on line 602. 
Buckeye provided its Baker Hughes Final Inspection Report, dated 11/03/2014 (2014 ILI) and its 
Baker Hughes CPIG In-Line Inspection Final Report, dated 10/28/2019 (2019 ILI). A review of 
the 2014 ILI and 2019 ILI for the joint associated with the Line 602 release revealed that fewer 
anomalies  were  boxed  in  the  2019  ILI  run  than  in  the  2014  ILI  run.  According  to  the  IMP 
procedures,  feature  information  from  the  previous  ILI  survey  is  incorporated  into  the  pipeline 
listing, and significant changes in event type, depth, length, and orientation are identified and noted 
for  further  review.  Thus,  a  reduction  in  boxed  anomalies  should  have  been  noted  for  further 
review1. 

Therefore, Buckeye failed to follow its procedures for reviewing and integrating data from current 
and previous ILI results in accordance with § 195.452(b)(5).

 Following the incident and pursuant to the Corrective Action Order 1-2021-034-CAO, Buckeye 
conducted  a  root  cause  failure  analysis  (RCFA)  of  the  incident.  Based  on  the  determinations 
contained  within  the  RCFA  report,  the  written  control  room  management  procedures  for 
investigating SCADA indications were not followed2. 

Therefore,  Buckeye  failed  to  follow  its  written  control  room  management  procedures  for 
investigating SCADA indications of a leak in accordance with § 195.446(a).
