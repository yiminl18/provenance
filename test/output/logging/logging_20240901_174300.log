 We have reviewed the circumstances and supporting documents involved in this case, and have 
decided not to propose a civil penalty assessment at this time. 

With respect to Item 2, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 60118, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety 
Administration proposes to issue a Compliance Order to Adelphia Gateway, LLC.  Please refer to 
the Proposed Compliance Order, which is enclosed and made a part of this Notice. 

Warning Items 

With respect to Items 1, 3, 4, and 5, we have reviewed the circumstances and supporting documents 
involved in this case and have decided not to conduct additional enforcement action or penalty 
assessment proceedings at this time.  We advise you to promptly correct these items.  Failure to 
do so may result in additional enforcement action.

 Adelphia’s  Valve  Security  Procedure  stated  in  part  that  “All  valves  shall  be  protected  from 
vandalism and unauthorized operations. Security may be provided by locks on the valve or location 
within locked fences or buildings.” 

During  the  inspection,  PHMSA  observed  multiple  gaps  under  the  fence  at  the  Columbia 
Interchange valve site in  Northampton County, PA. Not all valves were locked, and the gaps under 
the  fence  provided  possible  access  to  individuals  desirous  of  conducting  vandalism  and 
unauthorized operation of valves at the site. 

Therefore, Adelphia failed to follow its Valve Security Procedure as required per  § 192.605(a).
