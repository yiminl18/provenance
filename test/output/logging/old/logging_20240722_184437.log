 Models of Personal Informatics 
Li et al. develop a stage-based model of personal informatics 
systems  and  describe  barriers  people  face  in  each  stage 
(Figure 1) [21]. The model has five stages: 1) preparation, or 
starting to collect data and thinking about what information 
to  record  and  how  to  collect  it;  2)  collection,  or  gathering 
data;  3)  integration,  or  preparing  data  to  reflect  upon; 
4) reflection, or examining and exploring data; and 5) action, 
or  taking  one’s  newfound  understanding  of  themselves  to 
inform changes. Motivated by the Transtheoretical Model of 
Behavior  Change  (TTM)  [32],  Li  et  al.  later  identify  two 
phases  of  reflection,  discovery  and  maintenance,  and  note 
people ask different types of questions in each phase [22].

 ABSTRACT 
Current  models  of  how  people  use  personal  informatics 
systems are largely based in behavior change goals. They do 
not  adequately  characterize  the  integration  of  self-tracking 
into  everyday  life  by  people  with  varying  goals.  We  build 
upon  prior  work  by  embracing  the  perspective  of  lived 
informatics to propose a new model of personal informatics. 
We examine how lived informatics manifests in the habits of 
self-trackers across a variety of domains, first by surveying 
105, 99, and 83 past and present trackers of physical activity, 
finances, and location and then by interviewing 22 trackers 
regarding their lived informatics experiences. We develop a 
model characterizing tracker processes of deciding to track 
and selecting a tool, elaborate on tool usage during collection, 
integration,  and  reflection  as  components  of  tracking  and 
acting,  and  discuss  the  lapsing  and  potential  resuming  of 
tracking

 INTRODUCTION 
Personal informatics, or collecting and reflecting on personal 
information,  has  become  increasingly  prevalent.  Personal 
informatics can serve a goal-driven purpose, such as tracking 
weight loss, increasing physical activity, having a record of 
places  visited,  or  tracking  student  loan  payments.  Beyond 
these goal-driven motivations, self-tracking tools are now a 
part  of  everyday  life,  or  “lived  informatics”,  with  people 
tracking out of curiosity or a fascination with numbers [34]. 
The pervasiveness of self-tracking tools has led researchers 
to  study  people’s  use  of  commercial  tools  for  tracking 
location  [24,30],  finances  [20],  food  [11],  weight  [19,25], 
and  physical  activity  [16,34]  and  to  develop  research 
prototypes to expand our understanding of usage [3,8,12,40].
