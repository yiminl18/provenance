 The  full  survey  consisted  of  free  response  questions  about 
each current and previous tool, asking why they started and 
stopped using that tool as appropriate. The first two authors 
affinity diagrammed these responses, identified themes, and 
then separately qualitatively coded the responses, iteratively 
refining codes through discussion.

 I try to avoid it as much as possible… When you transition from 
tools,  there’s  a  lot  of  transaction  costs  in  terms  of  switching 
between one and the other. You just have to get your profile set 
up  again,  you  have  to  learn  to  interact  with  a  tool.  There’s

potential data loss. I don’t know if that matters, sometimes it 
does, but usually it’s something that I just kind of gave up on.

 The overhead of setting up a profile, learning a new interface, 
and  losing  his  data  were  too  much  for  p11  to  consider 
switching  tools.  While  he  desires  other  features,  saying 
“I want to have an aggregate sense of how many miles I’ve 
run for the past three months”, he is unwilling to switch to a 
new  tool  and  lose  all  of  his  built-up  knowledge.  Although 
lock-in  may  be  desirable  from  an  application  or  device 
manufacturer’s  point  of  view,  personal  informatics  tools 
could  better  support  their  users  with  designs  that  support 
evolving motivations and feature needs and allow people to 
migrate when the tool no longer best supports their goals.

 We  invited  each  Turker  who  had  self-tracked  in  a  domain 
(i.e.,  physical  activity,  location,  finances)  to  complete  a 
longer survey for that domain. They were compensated $2.00 
for  completing  the  approximately  15-minute  survey.  This

 Interview Methods 
After completion of qualitative coding of the survey data, the 
first  two  authors  identified  questions  that  required  further 
in-depth  interviews  to  address.  Of Turkers who indicated in 
the survey that they were willing to be contacted for interviews, 
36 respondents were identified as having representative tracking 
motivations,  behaviors,  and  experiences  and  were  verbose  in 
responses,  of  which  6  responded.  We  supplemented  these 
interviews  with  another  16  recruited  through  university 
mailing lists and posts to social media. These interviewees 
were screened for the same criteria as the Turkers.
