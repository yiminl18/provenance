INTRODUCTION
The development of mobile phone technology and biological
sensors is enabling individuals to self-track biological, phys-
ical and environmental information. From rich self-tracking
data, individuals can interpret and infer the patterns, correla-
tions and causal relations in their own behavior and wellbeing.

understanding of their data, especially to motivate users to
change their behaviors for the betterment of their own well-
