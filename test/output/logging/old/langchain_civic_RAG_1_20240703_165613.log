Insights from the \nfield  of  human-computer  interaction  should  play  a  big \npart  in  the  development  of  mixed-initiative  approaches \nfor effective personal informatics systems. \n\n•  Currently,  most  personal  informatics  systems  are  uni-\nfaceted.  Participants  expressed  desire  for  associating \ndifferent  aspects  of  their  lives  together.  Creating  multi-\nfaceted  systems  may  be  difficult  because  of  the  extra \ndata  that  need  to  be  collected,  however  the  insights \ngained  may  be  worth  it.  There  are  opportunities  to \nleverage  the  increasing  ability  of  ubiquitous  computing \nand  lifelogging  technologies  to  collect  various  types  of', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/extracted_data/A Stage-based Model of Personal Informatics Systems.txt', 'start_index': 56597, 'chunk_index': 71}), Document(page_content='CHI 2010: Performance, Stagecraft, and MagicApril 10–15, 2010, Atlanta, GA, USA565 \n\x0cinformation and show users multiple facets of their lives. \nThese  multiple  facets  must  be  displayed  in  ways  that \nusers can understand them and gain valuable insight into \ntheir lives. \n\nCONCLUSION \nPersonal informatics is a growing class of systems that can \nhelp  people  know  themselves  better.  More  people  are \nbuilding  such  systems  and  there  is  an  opportunity  to \nprovide  design \nfor  creating  more \neffective systems. \n\nrecommendations', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/extracted_data/A Stage-based Model of Personal Informatics Systems.txt', 'start_index': 57577, 'chunk_index': 72}), Document(page_content='recommendations \n\nIn  studying  how  people  use  personal  informatics  systems, \nwe  gained  an  understanding  of  their  motivations  and \npractices.  We  used  this  to  define  a  model  that  describes \npersonal  informatics  systems  as  a  series  of  5  stages.  We \ncompiled  a  comprehensive  list  of  barriers  that  people \nencountered in each stage. We also described properties of \nthe  stages:  cascading  effect  of  barriers,  iterative,  system-\ndriven  vs.  user-driven,  and  uni-faceted  vs.  multi-faceted. \nThese properties have implications in the design of personal \ninformatics \nshould  be  designed \nholistically;  2)  they  should  improve  support  for  iteration \nbetween  stages;  3)  an  appropriate  balance  of  automated \ntechnology  and  user  control  should  be  applied  within  each \nstage  to  facilitate  the  user  experience;  and  4)  they  should \nexplore  support  for  multiple  facets  of  people’s  lives  to \nenrich the value of systems.', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/extracted_data/A Stage-based Model of Personal Informatics Systems.txt', 'start_index': 58111, 'chunk_index': 73}), Document(page_content='systems:  1) \n\nthey \n\nframework \npersonal \n\nWe believe the model and its properties will be valuable for \nfuture  research  and  development  because  it  provides  a \nfor  describing,  comparing,  and \ncommon \nevaluating \nsystems.  Personal \ninformatics \ninformatics  systems  pose  new  interesting  HCI  challenges. \nWe believe that the stage-based model, the identification of \nthe  barriers  within  each  stage,  and  the  description  of  the \nproperties  of  the  stages  will  help  HCI  researchers  and \npractitioners  find  solutions  and  explore  new  approaches  in \npersonal informatics more efficiently. \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nWe  would \nparticipants and the websites that helped our recruitment. \n\nthank  our  survey  and \n\nlike \n\nto \n\ninterview \n\nREFERENCES \n1.
