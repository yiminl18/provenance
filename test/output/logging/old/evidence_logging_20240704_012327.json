            "CONCLUSION\nWhile  the  literature  on  reflection  and  reflective  thought  is\ndecades  old  [e.g., 20], reflection has only recently come to\nfocus  in  HCI.  While  the  oldest  paper  in  our  corpus  was\npublished in 2000, most papers in the review presented here\nwere  published  in  the  years  since  2009.  We  suggest  this\nrecency  as  evidence  of  increasing  interest  in  designing  for\nreflection. Indeed, an increased interest in reflection aligns\nclosely  with  many  concerns  concomitant  with  third  wave\nHCI [11,35]. As research progresses in this area, we believe\nthat  the  directions  described  in  our  discussion  section  will\nbe  helpful  in  shaping  research  trajectory.
