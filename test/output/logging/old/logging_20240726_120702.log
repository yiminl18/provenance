Dear Mr. Sauger: 

From  March  16,  2021  through  May  30,  2021,  a  representative  of  the  Pipeline  and  Hazardous 
Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS),  pursuant to Chapter 
601 of 49 United States Code (U.S.C.) investigated Buckeye Partners, LP’s (Buckeye) in-service, 
rupture in Linden, NJ. 

On  March  16,  2021,  at  5:26  am  Eastern  Standard  Time  (EST),  Buckeye  Line  602  ruptured 
releasing 353 barrels (bbls) of unleaded gasoline into a marsh in Linden, New Jersey.

 Following the receipt of this Notice, you have 30 days to  respond as described in the enclosed 
Response Options.  If you do not respond within 30 days of receipt of this Notice, this constitutes 
a  waiver  of  your  right  to  contest  the  allegations  in  this  Notice  and  authorizes  the  Associate 
Administrator for Pipeline Safety to find facts as alleged in this Notice without further notice to 
you and to issue a Final Order.  If you are responding to this Notice, we propose that you submit 
your  correspondence to my office  within  30 days  from the receipt  of this Notice.  The Region 
Director  may  extend  the  period  for  responding  upon  a  written  request  timely  submitted 
demonstrating good cause for an extension. 

In  your  correspondence  on  this  matter,  please  refer  to  CPF  1-2023-011-NOPV,  and,  for  each 
document you submit, please provide a copy in electronic format whenever possible.

 Enclosed as part of this Notice is a document entitled Response Options for Pipeline Operators in 
Enforcement  Proceedings.  Please  refer  to  this  document  and  note  the  response  options. All 
material you submit in response to this enforcement action may be made publicly available.  If you 
believe that any portion of your responsive material qualifies for confidential treatment under 5 
U.S.C. § 552(b), along with the complete original document you must provide a second copy of 
the  document  with  the  portions  you  believe  qualify  for  confidential  treatment  redacted  and  an 
explanation of why you believe the redacted information qualifies for confidential treatment under 
5 U.S.C. § 552(b).

 During the investigation, PHMSA requested ILI records for the 2019 and 2014 runs on line 602. 
Buckeye provided its Baker Hughes Final Inspection Report, dated 11/03/2014 (2014 ILI) and its 
Baker Hughes CPIG In-Line Inspection Final Report, dated 10/28/2019 (2019 ILI). A review of 
the 2014 ILI and 2019 ILI for the joint associated with the Line 602 release revealed that fewer 
anomalies  were  boxed  in  the  2019  ILI  run  than  in  the  2014  ILI  run.  According  to  the  IMP 
procedures,  feature  information  from  the  previous  ILI  survey  is  incorporated  into  the  pipeline 
listing, and significant changes in event type, depth, length, and orientation are identified and noted 
for  further  review.  Thus,  a  reduction  in  boxed  anomalies  should  have  been  noted  for  further 
review1. 

Therefore, Buckeye failed to follow its procedures for reviewing and integrating data from current 
and previous ILI results in accordance with § 195.452(b)(5).

 Following the incident and pursuant to the Corrective Action Order 1-2021-034-CAO, Buckeye 
conducted  a  root  cause  failure  analysis  (RCFA)  of  the  incident.  Based  on  the  determinations 
contained  within  the  RCFA  report,  the  written  control  room  management  procedures  for 
investigating SCADA indications were not followed2. 

Therefore,  Buckeye  failed  to  follow  its  written  control  room  management  procedures  for 
investigating SCADA indications of a leak in accordance with § 195.446(a).
