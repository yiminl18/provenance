make an interesting starting point for analysis. However, if 
it is too difficult to collect, I have better things to do with 
my time.” 
This property of personal informatics systems opens several 
opportunities for research and applications. Many existing 
technologies are capable of collecting various types of 
personal information, and researchers in ubiquitous 
computing and lifelogging are developing new collection 
tools. How can personal informatics systems leverage these 
new technologies to inform people about different facets of 
their lives? What would visualizations that show multiple 
facets of people's lives look like? How should they be 
designed so that non-experts (most people) can gain 
insights about their lives?
Limitations of the Survey and Model
We recruited participants from a blog dedicated to personal 
informatics, a blog about general information visualization, 
and two personal informatics web sites, so most survey 
participants were familiar with personal informatics. Since 
even these interested users had plenty of problems with
different systems, we suspect that the problems they 
encountered may be a subset of problems that common
users may experience. We think it would be interesting to 
study users with little or no prior experience with personal 
informatics systems to find specific barriers that they may 
encounter.
CASE STUDIES
Having identified the stages model, the properties of the 
stages, and the barriers experienced within the stages, we 
can now apply the model to analyze personal informatics 
systems. In this section, we evaluate existing personal 
informatics systems to demonstrate the use of the model. In 
consideration of space, we only highlight some aspects of 
each system. We describe barriers that users may encounter 
and suggest potential solutions to explore further.

 caffeine consumption, meal times, weight) into the reports 
depending on his hypotheses (e.g., what is the effect of 
caffeine consumption on my sleep patterns?).
The iterative property of personal informatics systems 
suggests that systems should be flexible to support users' 
changing information needs. Systems could be flexible by 
1) supporting importing data from other systems, as well as, 
exporting to other systems; and 2) supporting different 
kinds of information. Since tool changes may render 
previously collected data useless, systems should support 
rapid iteration, so that users can quickly hone in on the 
questions they want to answer and select the appropriate 
tools to collect the necessary information.
User-driven vs. System-driven 
Each stage can be classified as user-driven, system-driven, 
or a combination of both. When a stage is user-driven, the 
user is responsible for the activity in the stage. In the 
Preparation stage, the user decides what type of information 
to collect and what tools to use. User-driven collection is 
when users record information on paper or enter 
information into a spreadsheet, an application, or a website 
form. User-driven integration is when users have to 
transcribe collected information, so that they can reflect on 
it. In the Reflection stage, the user reflects on the 
information without the aid of visualizations or other tools 
for exploring the data. In the Action stage, the user is 
responsible for deciding on actions to take depending on 
their conclusions from the data without aid from the system.
User-driven stages demand time and attention from the 
user. This is problematic when the demand becomes too 
much (e.g., high frequency of collection). There are ways to 
facilitate user-driven stages. For example, systems that use 
user-driven collection can motivate the user to collect the 
information. Hsieh and colleagues [11] have explored this

 section, the survey asked what patterns, trends, and 
surprises participants found from reflecting on their 
information. The survey ended with demographics 
questions (e.g., gender, age range, marital status, 
employment, education, and technology use). The 
following are example questions from the survey1:
• How difficult is it to collect this personal information?
• What was your initial motivation to reflect on this 
collected personal information?
• What patterns (repeating events) have you found when 
exploring this collected personal information?
Participants

forums at two personal informatics web sites
(http://slifelabs.com and http://moodjam.org). We chose 
these web sites because their readers and users were more 
likely to have used one or more personal informatics 
systems. Survey participants were entered into a raffle for a 
$25 Amazon gift certificate. We interviewed a subset of 
these participants using instant messenger to collect 
additional details about their responses. Interviewees 
received an additional $10 Amazon gift certificate. 
We had 68 people complete the surveys, and 11 agreed to 
participate in the follow-up interviews. 37 participants were 
male. Ages ranged from 18 to 64 with a median age range 
of 26 to 30. About half had graduate degrees and another 
half were in college. More than half worked full-time. 
Participants were technologically savvy. 90% of 
participants used email or instant messenger daily to 
communicate. 60% of them used social networking sites 
daily. Most read news websites and blogs, ordered products 
online, and managed bills and bank accounts online.

about ME (her emphasis).”
Finding personal informatics tools also encouraged people 
to start collecting information. P48 said, “I’ve been 
following Nick Felton’s annual reports so when he started 
Daytum, I joined to start tracking which restaurants I ate 
at.” Others cited trigger events, such as problems in 
relationships (P60, P1), sleep patterns (P44), and weight 
(P21, P23, P37). Sometimes, the trigger event is combined 
with an extra push from another person. P49 started
collecting blood sugar level and blood pressure information 
because of “a doctor’s recommendation (new medical issue, 
new medications).”
STAGES AND BARRIERS
We will now introduce the stage-based model of personal 
informatics that we derived from analysis of the survey and 
interview data. The model is composed of a series of five 
stages (Figure 1): Preparation, Collection, Integration, 
Reflection, and Action. We define each stage and, for each 
one, describe the barriers that participants experienced.
Preparation Stage
The Preparation stage occurs before people start collecting 
personal information. This stage concerns itself with 
people’s motivation to collect personal information, how 
they determine what information they will record, and how 
they will record it.
Barriers in the Preparation stage are related to determining 
what information to collect and what collection tool to use. 
As noted, some people stumble upon tools, which drive 
them to start collecting. However, this becomes a problem 
when the tool does not satisfy their information needs. This 
causes them to switch to another tool, which has two 
negative consequences: 1) they abandon their previous data 
because most systems do not support data exporting, and 2) 
if they can export data, the formats between the applications 
may not be the same. For example, P48 used Google

 caffeine consumption, meal times, weight) into the reports

User-driven vs. System-driven 
Each stage can be classified as user-driven, system-driven, 
or a combination of both. When a stage is user-driven, the 
user is responsible for the activity in the stage. In the 
Preparation stage, the user decides what type of information 
to collect and what tools to use. User-driven collection is 
when users record information on paper or enter 
information into a spreadsheet, an application, or a website 
form. User-driven integration is when users have to 
transcribe collected information, so that they can reflect on 
it. In the Reflection stage, the user reflects on the

for exploring the data. In the Action stage, the user is 
responsible for deciding on actions to take depending on 
their conclusions from the data without aid from the system.

 facilitate user-driven stages. For example, systems that use 
user-driven collection can motivate the user to collect the 
information. Hsieh and colleagues [11] have explored this 
in the context of experience sampling; they encouraged
participation in an ESM study by showing reflective 
visualizations. An alternative way to dealing with the 
burden of user-driven stages is to transfer the responsibility 
completely to the system, i.e., making them system-driven. 
When a stage is system-driven, the system takes on the 
responsibility of performing the tasks in the stage. In the 
Preparation stage, the system can suggest to users the 
appropriate tools and information that will help them 
answer their questions about themselves. In the Collection 
stage, the system can collect personal information by using 
sensors (e.g., pedometers), or keeping a record of 
transactions (e.g., bank statements, search history). Systemdriven collection can also involve other people, e.g., a nurse 
writes the data for the patient into a web site. In the 
Integration stage, the system can aggregate and prepare the 
information for reflection, e.g., Mint aggregates data from 
different banks and credit card companies. In the Reflection 
stage, the system can help users reflect on and explore their 
information using visualizations. In the Action stage, 
systems can alert the user to take action, e.g., Wakoopa 
(http://wakoopa.com) suggests new applications and 
websites depending on the person's computer usage.
This property of the stages suggests that there are 
opportunities within each stage of a system to use a systemdriven approach to alleviate the demands on the user. 
However, designers should consider the tradeoffs between a 
system-driven approach (e.g., inaccuracies of automated 
analysis, and loss of user control) and a user-driven 
approach (e.g., burden and complexity). Developers and

2024-06-21 13:51:23,681 - root - INFO - final_answer: When processing data from user studies, several statistical methods are commonly employed. These methods include descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, and data visualization. Descriptive statistics are used to summarize the main features of the data, providing insights into central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the dataset. Inferential statistics, on the other hand, are utilized to make predictions or inferences about a larger population based on a sample collected from the user study. Data visualization plays a crucial role in representing data visually, enabling researchers to identify patterns, correlations, and trends within the collected data.

Moreover, the process of handling data from user studies involves several key steps. These steps typically include Preparation, Collection, Integration, Reflection, and Action stages. During the Preparation stage, researchers determine what information needs to be collected and how it should be recorded. The data collection process can be user-driven, system-driven, or a combination of both, depending on the specific objectives of the study. By following these structured steps and leveraging appropriate statistical methods, researchers can effectively process and analyze data gathered from user studies to derive meaningful insights and make informed decisions.
