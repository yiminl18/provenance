it is too difficult to collect, I have better things to do with

This property of personal informatics systems opens several 
opportunities for research and applications. Many existing 
technologies are capable of collecting various types of 
personal information, and researchers in ubiquitous 
computing and lifelogging are developing new collection 
tools. How can personal informatics systems leverage these 
new technologies to inform people about different facets of 
their lives? What would visualizations that show multiple 
facets of people's lives look like? How should they be 
designed so that non-experts (most people) can gain 
insights about their lives? 
Limitations of the Survey and Model 
We recruited participants from a blog dedicated to personal 
informatics, a blog about general information visualization, 
and two personal informatics web sites, so most survey 
participants were familiar with personal informatics. Since 
even these interested users had plenty of problems with 
different systems, we suspect that the problems they 
encountered may be a subset of problems that common 
users may experience. We think it would be interesting to 
study users with little or no prior experience with personal 
informatics systems to find specific barriers that they may 
encounter. 
CASE STUDIES 
Having identified the stages model, the properties of the 
stages, and the barriers experienced within the stages, we 
can now apply the model to analyze personal informatics 
systems. In this section, we evaluate existing personal 
informatics systems to demonstrate the use of the model. In 
consideration of space, we only highlight some aspects of 
each system. We describe barriers that users may encounter 
and suggest potential solutions to explore further.

daily. Most read news websites and blogs, ordered products 
online, and managed bills and bank accounts online. 
RESULTS 
We created affinity diagrams to analyze the survey and 
interviews. We did not determine a coding scheme 
beforehand; instead we identified themes from the data as 
we processed the responses. During the analysis, we 
identified the types of personal information collected and 
reflected on by participants, motivations for collection and 
reflection, and problems experienced. Next, we analyzed 
the survey and interviews for experiences with tools and 
barriers that users encountered, identifying a model of 
personal informatics. 
Collected Personal Information 
Participants reported a wide variety of information that they 
collected and reflected on (see Table 1). Many participants 
reflected on automatically collected information such as 
bank statements and email history, since they are readily 
available. Automatically collected information was split

depending on his hypotheses (e.g., what is the effect of 
caffeine consumption on my sleep patterns?). 
The iterative property of personal informatics systems 
suggests that systems should be flexible to support users' 
changing information needs. Systems could be flexible by 
1) supporting importing data from other systems, as well as, 
exporting to other systems; and 2) supporting different 
kinds of information. Since tool changes may render 
previously collected data useless, systems should support 
rapid iteration, so that users can quickly hone in on the 
questions they want to answer and select the appropriate 
tools to collect the necessary information. 
User-driven vs. System-driven  
Each stage can be classified as user-driven, system-driven, 
or a combination of both. When a stage is user-driven, the 
user is responsible for the activity in the stage. In the 
Preparation stage, the user decides what type of information 
to collect and what tools to use. User-driven collection is 
when users record information on paper or enter 
information into a spreadsheet, an application, or a website 
form. User-driven integration is when users have to 
transcribe collected information, so that they can reflect on 
it. In the Reflection stage, the user reflects on the 
information without the aid of visualizations or other tools 
for exploring the data. In the Action stage, the user is 
responsible for deciding on actions to take depending on 
their conclusions from the data without aid from the system. 
User-driven stages demand time and attention from the 
user. This is problematic when the demand becomes too 
much (e.g., high frequency of collection). There are ways to 
facilitate user-driven stages. For example, systems that use 
user-driven collection can motivate the user to collect the 
information. Hsieh and colleagues [11] have explored this 
in the context of experience sampling; they encouraged
