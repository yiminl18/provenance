 Interestingly,  although  reflection  plays  a  prominent  role  in
personal informatics and related work, the final stage of Li
et  al.’s  [55]  model,  and  the  goal  of  much  similar  work,  is
action. Their line of reasoning suggests that showing users
data  about  themselves  will  lead  them  to do  something,
presumably  something  different  from  and  better  than  what
they  are  already  doing.  For  example,  showing  diabetics
blood sugar levels will increase their ability to manage their
condition  [25];  showing  frequency  of  shortcut  key  usage
will increase their usage [62]; showing mouse accuracy will
reduce  exaggerated  movements  and  improve  future
performance  [44].  Indeed,  the  idea  of  inciting  behavioral
change occurred implicitly in much of the papers reviewed
here.  However,  these  papers  also  varied  in  the  degree  of
prescribing  exactly  of  what  that  behavioral  change  should
consist, raising comparisons with persuasion.

 The Constitution of Reflection
Many  of  the  papers  in  this  review  described  interventions
designed  to  support  or  encourage  reflection  in  some  way.
However, the lack of definition or deeper engagement with
the  concept  of  reflection  poses  challenges  for  design.  For
example,  what  does  it  take  to  reflect?  How  can
interventions  provide  spaces  that  are  conducive  to
reflection?  As  mentioned  above,  the  Personal  Informatics
model  described  reflection as “looking at lists  of  collected
personal  information  or  exploring  or  interacting  with
information  visualizations,”  [55:562].  This  definition
carries  an  implicit  assumption  that  by  providing  access  to
data  that  has  been  “prepared,  combined,  and  transformed”
[55:561] for the purpose of reflection, reflection will occur.
