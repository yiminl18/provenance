 We’ve seen traditional quantitative reflective designs made
powerful with an intelligent narrative, such as in Hans
Rosling’s talks on the visualization of statistics [22]. The
statistics are brought to life by a dynamic, emotional narrative,
which induces audience’s curiosity and empathy towards the
story behind the figures. It takes storytelling skills and a deep
understanding of the background knowledge to create these
engaging narratives, which is difficult to realize for chaotic and
often sparse self-tracking data on an individual basis, where
the causal and correlational relations are hard to capture. Furthermore, an engaging narrative for personal data should be
based on a knowledge of personal context. For example, when
a mobile phone app records reduced exercise rate, it could be
either due to a downturn of mood or a vacation. The narrative
to motivate the user to get back on track in exercise should
take into account these personal contextual differences.
We attempt to create emotional, personal narratives of data
related to behavior and mental wellbeing by making animated
movies customized to each individual’s emotional trajectory.
Readers can compare our story world to the animated movie
Inside Out, where emotions are symbolized as characters and
environment designs. To make it practical for a large number of users, we created a novel fully automated animation
generator that works by parameterizing animations, within a

 asked, "what do you think the video reflected about you".
While physiological, behavioral and self-report data can be
used to track user’s psychological processes [19], in this work,
we use self-reported mood and behavior data for three reasons:
First, we can avoid challenges in the interpretation of physiology data, such as the difficulty in distinguishing between joy
and anger [3]; Second, users can recall and implicitly select
the affective states they wish to have feedback on, which promotes mindfulness and awareness of their emotions [1]; Third,
users are required to recall the past 24 hours every day, so their
memory of the events should be relatively reliable [12].
The goal of this project is to open up the design space where
users’ mood and behavior data are relived in an emotional
narrative, in order to maximize viewer’s self-compassion and
motivation to maintain or change their behavior post viewing.
We demonstrate in a one-week randomized control study that
while both animation don’t involve a traditional "story" narrative, users are better at interpreting personalized animations
compared to a generic animation; that users are able to connect
to the animated agent, engage with the animated movies emotionally and constructively reflect on their mood and behavior
patterns.

RELATED WORK
This section summarizes previous research on designing HCI
systems to reflect affective states and building motivational
narratives for self-reflection and behavior change.
Reflective Design
Reflective design focuses on embedding unconscious cultural
assumptions and values in the design of IT systems, in particular to promote a user’s critical understanding of such values

 protocol and recruitment process are pre-approved by the MIT
Committee On the Use of Humans as Experimental Subjects
(COUHES).
We sent emails to university labs and dorms, recruiting 27 participants aged 18-36. Random assignment was made resulting
in 13 of them assigned to the control group, and 14 to the personalized group. One participant in the control group dropped
out of the study and asked to have his/her data deleted. All
participants took pre-study surveys including tests on personality, stress level and mental health status. Each day during the
week, participants reported their daily mood and behavioral
data through an online Google Forms survey.
At the end of the week, participants received an animated
movie through email, and were instructed to watch it. Members of the personalized group each received a story that was
personalized according to each individual’s mood and behavioral data, while the control group receive a non-personalized
animated video of the same length, featuring a corgi dog rendered from the same models. Considering that the one-line
cues are part of the personalization package, they were only
used in the personalized group. The control video is generated
from real data of a preliminary study participant, showing the
corgi dog running through a forest, facing a stressful rain of
rocks, having one negative and one positive interaction with
another dog and in the end running uphill on a good note.
The control video was picked such that it features some ups
and downs that all participants might relate to their surveyed
experience.
All participants were told the same story: that the video was
customized to their mood and behavior data. After watching
the videos, participants filled out an evaluation form. There
were three questions that accepted free text-form responses,
without prompting the participants with any of the researcher’s
preconceptions such as "stress" or "social interaction":
