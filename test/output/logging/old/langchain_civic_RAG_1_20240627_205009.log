Limitations 
We focused on three common, yet diverse, domains in which 
people self-track. People self-track in many other domains, 
including to manage chronic illnesses, in which people might 
have different motivations or tracking habits. Although we 
believe our findings are extensible to domains other than the 
three on which we report (e.g., biometric or food tracking), 
they do not necessarily cover all motivations and usages. 
Some people track the domains we study using different 
classes of tools that we do not extensively report on, such as 
tools that passively record location (e.g., Moves, SenseCam 
[17]). Although we believe this suggests these are used 
relatively infrequently compared to those we report on 
(or possible limitations in our recruitment techniques), our 
findings on tracking in a particular domain may not 
generalize to all tools or people tracking that type of data. 
We believe our recruitment overrepresents people who 
currently identify as self-trackers, as our recruitment 
materials were likely to draw people who were currently 
interested in self-tracking (e.g., posting the task on AMT as 
a “Survey on Location, Physical Activity, and Finance 
Tracking”). This is one weakness of our research, and future 
work should further explore people’s reasons for deciding 
not to return to tracking.

We develop a \r\nmodel characterizing tracker processes of deciding to track \r\nand selecting a tool, elaborate on tool usage during collection, \r\nintegration, and reflection as components of tracking and \r\nacting, and discuss the lapsing and potential resuming of \r\ntracking.

Personal \r\ninformatics can serve a goal-driven purpose, such as tracking \r\nweight loss, increasing physical activity, having a record of \r\nplaces visited, or tracking student loan payments.

The model characterizes how people \r\ntransition between preparation, collection, integration, \r\nreflection, and action, describing the iterative nature of these \r\nstages and the barriers that prevent transitions. The model \r\nemphasizes an end goal of knowledge supporting behavior \r\nchange. The model has since been expanded and clarified, \r\ndividing and combining stages. For goal-oriented trackers, \r\nreflection can be divided into maintenance and discovery\r\n[22]. For some trackers, engagement with and gaining an \r\nunderstanding of personal data may be the goal in itself, \r\ncausing the action stage to be foregone [41]. Reflection often \r\noccurs during collection rather than being a separate stage \r\n[6], which leads to an alternative three-stage iterative model \r\nof configuration, data capture, and feedback [7]. \r\nHowever, research on everyday self-tracking behavior \r\nidentifies several uses of personal informatics not described \r\nby current models. For example, the five-stage model \r\ndescribes self-trackers switching tools to better fit their \r\ninformation needs [21]. People also switch tools because \r\ntheir devices break [16,34], they change phones [34], or \r\nbecause they receive a new recommendation [34]. \r\nSelf-trackers also fail to sustain the habit or get frustrated and \r\ngive up on tools [11].

Articulating a model that encompasses \r\nthese behaviors can offer better guidance to designers. \r\nTo develop this model, we studied self-tracking of a variety \r\nof behaviors to understand how lived informatics manifests \r\nin the habits of self-trackers. Specifically, we surveyed 105, \r\n99, and 83 past and present trackers of physical activity, \r\nfinances, and location on their habits and conducted 22 \r\ninterviews. We report on how people decide to start tracking \r\nand pick a tool, how they use that tool, how and why people \r\nswitch between tools, and why people stop tracking. We \r\ndevelop an expanded model that captures the practices of \r\nself-trackers motivated to track to change behaviors, \r\ninstrumenting an activity, and curiosity.\r\nSpecifically, we find: \r\n• In addition to being motivated to track in support of \r\nbehavior change goals, people start tracking to instrument \r\nan activity or out of pure curiosity. \r\n• People’s motivations for tracking guide the selection of \r\ntracking tools.

The model has five stages: 1) preparation, or \r\nstarting to collect data and thinking about what information \r\nto record and how to collect it; 2) collection, or gathering \r\ndata; 3) integration, or preparing data to reflect upon; \r\n4) reflection, or examining and exploring data; and 5) action, \r\nor taking one’s newfound understanding of themselves to \r\ninform changes. Motivated by the Transtheoretical Model of \r\nBehavior Change (TTM) [32], Li et al. later identify two \r\nphases of reflection, discovery and maintenance, and note \r\npeople ask different types of questions in each phase [22]. \r\nFrom studying practices of the Quantified Self movement, \r\nChoe et al. learn that reflection often occurs when data is \r\ncaptured [6] and propose a new model for self-monitoring \r\ntechnology, including reflection through data capture as well \r\nas through feedback [7]. Similarly, Whooley et al. note the \r\npotential for personal informatics tools to support Schön’s \r\nreflection-in-action [36], where self-trackers contemplate \r\ntheir data and change their behavior while tracking [41]. \r\nThese models describe trackers who have a behavior change \r\ngoal, but some have other motivations. People also self-track \r\nfor self-understanding [34], never acting upon their data. \r\nStarting to Track \r\nMany people start tracking because they have goals in mind \r\n[15,19,22,34]. Weight trackers often have a specific target \r\nweight, and use the weight as a proxy for their progress \r\ntowards other fitness goals [19]. Although many physical \r\nactivity trackers track to change or maintain a behavior, \r\nothers start without a specific goal or use tools to help set', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/raw_data/A Lived Informatics Model of Personal Informatics.pdf', 'page': 1, 'start_index': 1958, 'chunk_index': 6}), Document(page_content="towards other fitness goals [19]. Although many physical \r\nactivity trackers track to change or maintain a behavior, \r\nothers start without a specific goal or use tools to help set \r\ngoals (e.g., determine what actions to take to fix a problem \r\n[22] or identify the “baseline” to observe changes [34]). \r\nRewards, such as discounts or badges, motivate many people \r\nto track location (e.g., Foursquare [24]) and physical activity \r\n[34]. Some start tracking physical activity to generate \r\nincome (e.g., recording workouts on Pact) [34]. Many \r\nFoursquare users also start tracking to offer awareness to \r\nfriends and see where they are, or simply to keep track of \r\nplaces they have been (e.g., bars and restaurants) [21]. \r\nPeople also start tracking to keep a record for later retrieval, \r\nsuch as TV shows and movies watched [22]. \r\nAnother common motivation to start tracking is out of \r\ncuriosity [24] or an interest in quantitative data [21]. Some \r\nfood journalers [11] and physical activity trackers [34] start \r\ntracking to learn more about their behavior, such as their \r\neating habits or steps walked in their daily commute. \r\nPeople select specific tracking tools based on features, \r\nbranding, convenience (e.g., whether it is easy to carry), \r\nrecommendations of friends and relatives, and reviews in app \r\nstores and media [20,21,34]. People often receive tools as \r\ngifts, which is a selection on their behalf [34]. \r\nHow People Track \r\nPeople collect personal data with varying frequency based on \r\nthe kind of data. For example, food consumption is typically \r\nFigure 1. Li et al.’s five-stage model of personal informatics,\r\nreprinted with permission [21]. Primarily informed by\r\ntracking toward behavior change, the model emphasizes data\r\nbarriers toward a presumed action. We extend this model to\r\ncharacterize challenges in lived informatics. \r\n732\r\nUBICOMP '15, SEPTEMBER 7–11, 2015, OSAKA, JAPAN", metadata={'source': 'data/paper/raw_data/A Lived Informatics Model of Personal Informatics.pdf', 'page': 1, 'start_index': 0, 'chunk_index': 7}), Document(page_content='tracked several times a day, while one may only track books \r\nread a few times per month [21]. People may also track only \r\nsome of their activities (e.g., particular cycle rides or hikes), \r\nor everything (e.g., a food log or a complete step count) [34]. \r\nThe length of tool usage varies by domain. Many who track \r\nphysical activity have kept records for a year or more [16], \r\nthough newcomers reduce the average duration of use [34]. \r\nFinancial trackers use tools for longer, such as non-digital \r\nsystems to keep track of investment in municipal bonds for \r\nnearly 50 years [20]. Food journalers vary in how long they \r\nkeep the habit, ranging from 1 week to over 2 years, with a \r\nmedian of 7-12 months [10]. Tool usage also varies by \r\navailability. Commercial activity trackers are much newer than \r\nnon-digital methods often used to track finances and food. \r\nPeople rarely maintain use of the same tool and often switch \r\nand mix tools when tracking [34]. Some people track the \r\nsame habit with two tools, which leads to synchronization \r\ncomplications (e.g., step tracking with a pedometer and a \r\nphone app syncing to MyFitnessPal) [21]. Others track \r\ndifferent types of activities with different tools (e.g., Map My \r\nRun for running and Wii Fit for weight monitoring [34]), \r\nwhich usually leads to difficulties in organizing and \r\nreviewing data across separate tools and formats [21]. \r\nMany physical activity trackers look at their information \r\nimmediately after collection [21] to gain awareness of \r\ncurrent status and correct behavior towards goals (e.g., see \r\ntheir current step total and how many more steps needed for \r\n10,000 steps) [16,34]. Some people show little interest in \r\nreflecting on long-term data [34], while others use it to see \r\npatterns and trends over time [22]. Financial trackers use the \r\nidea of a financial touch, or a quick glimpse at data to gain \r\nawareness into their financial situations [20].', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/raw_data/A Lived Informatics Model of Personal Informatics.pdf', 'page': 2, 'start_index': 0, 'chunk_index': 8}), Document(page_content='People change their goals and practices over time, which is \r\nnot well-supported by personal informatics systems [22]. \r\nThese changes sometimes lead to selecting a new tool [21]. \r\nSome people who start without clear goals narrow their data \r\ncollection once they identify actionable goals, moving from \r\ndiscovery phase to maintenance phase of reflecting [22]. \r\nPeople also switch tools as their practices evolve over time \r\nand what a system supports does no longer matches their \r\npriorities (e.g., a jogger starting to do yoga) [16]. \r\nLapsing and Infrequent Use \r\nDocumentary tracking focuses on documenting activities \r\ninstead of changing them. It can be accomplished with a \r\nrelatively short-term endeavor to build up a collection of data \r\nfor reflection, and many people stop tracking after reflecting \r\n[34]. However, this is not true for everyone. Some long-term \r\nphysical activity trackers continue to track after they have \r\nlearned their patterns and routines, because they either \r\nbenefit from the continuous reflection or the application \r\ncontinues to keep a record without interaction (e.g., passively \r\nrecording activity from phone accelerometer data) [16]. \r\nIn studies of research prototypes, some participants reduce \r\ntheir interactions from a daily basis to a few times a week as \r\nstudies progress [23]. Participants mention inconvenience, \r\nforgetting to log, and forgetting to put on a wearable device \r\nas reasons for the reducing their use. Abandonment of \r\nconsumer technology has been studied in other areas of HCI. \r\nDawe reports that 35% of purchased assistive technologies \r\nare not adopted, and recommends that designs be simple to \r\nconfigure, upgrade, and replace (in addition to interact with) \r\n[13].

We strived for diversity in \r\nthe types of data tracked, similar to the original five-stage \r\nmodel [21] and its proposed expansions and clarifications \r\n[6,22,41]. Physical activity was selected because it is perhaps \r\nthe most common topic of self-tracking today, is included by \r\ndefault with present and announced wearables (e.g., Apple \r\nHealthKit and Watch, Microsoft Band), and is often studied \r\nwhen making broader claims about personal informatics \r\n(e.g., [15,16,34]). Finances were selected because people \r\nhave long tracked them manually (e.g., ledgers and then \r\nspreadsheets) and there are now tools that support tracking \r\nfinances automatically (e.g., tools from a bank or an \r\naggregator such as Mint.com). Location tracking is common \r\nand is a historically important branch of research in the \r\nUbicomp community (e.g. [9,18,24,37,38]). Prior work \r\nsuggests that location tracking may differ from the other \r\ndomains, in that it is often socially motivated and goals are \r\ntypically less articulated and numeric compared to other \r\ndomains. The equivalent of “walk 10,000 steps today” or \r\n“save $1,000 this month” is unclear for location tracking. \r\nSurvey Methods \r\nWe surveyed people on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), \r\nwhich has been shown to be closer to U.S. demographics than \r\nconventional convenience samples [5]. One potential concern \r\nis that people on AMT potentially represent a younger, more \r\ntechnologically literate population, but we believe this is \r\nconsistent with demographics of current self-trackers. \r\nWe restricted participation to Turkers in the United States. \r\nTo ensure response quality, we further restricted \r\nparticipation to Turkers who had a task acceptance rate of at \r\nleast 95% and had completed at least 1,000 tasks. We', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/raw_data/A Lived Informatics Model of Personal Informatics.pdf', 'page': 2, 'start_index': 0, 'chunk_index': 10}), Document(page_content='surveyed 200 Turkers, compensating each with $0.50 for a \r\nshort screener survey (less than 2 minutes) in which they \r\nindicated all (if any) self-tracking tools they had used \r\npreviously. Finally, Turkers were presented a short free \r\nresponse question that the first author analyzed for quality, a \r\nrecommended practice in AMT surveys [14]. We rejected \r\nthree tasks as spam: two left the free response question \r\neffectively blank (e.g., “N/A”); one did not enter a code \r\nshowing they had completed the survey. \r\nWe invited each Turker who had self-tracked in a domain \r\n(i.e., physical activity, location, finances) to complete a \r\nlonger survey for that domain.

We believe these \r\nresponses came from Turkers who started the task on AMT, \r\ncompleted the survey, but did not submit the task before it \r\nexpired (one hour after they started the task on AMT).\r\nIn total, 168 unique people of the 169 eligible completed the \r\nfull survey in at least one domain. We rejected two additional \r\nresponses (one physical activity, one location) because the \r\nTurker indicated they did not use any self-tracking tools in \r\nthe full survey.

Although we \r\nbelieve our findings are extensible to domains other than the \r\nthree on which we report (e.g., biometric or food tracking), \r\nthey do not necessarily cover all motivations and usages. \r\nSome people track the domains we study using different \r\nclasses of tools that we do not extensively report on, such as \r\ntools that passively record location (e.g., Moves, SenseCam \r\n[17]). Although we believe this suggests these are used \r\nrelatively infrequently compared to those we report on \r\n(or possible limitations in our recruitment techniques), our \r\nfindings on tracking in a particular domain may not \r\ngeneralize to all tools or people tracking that type of data. \r\nWe believe our recruitment overrepresents people who \r\ncurrently identify as self-trackers, as our recruitment \r\nmaterials were likely to draw people who were currently \r\ninterested in self-tracking (e.g., posting the task on AMT as \r\na “Survey on Location, Physical Activity, and Finance \r\nTracking”). This is one weakness of our research, and future \r\nwork should further explore people’s reasons for deciding \r\nnot to return to tracking. \r\nDEVELOPMENT OF A LIVED INFORMATICS MODEL', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/raw_data/A Lived Informatics Model of Personal Informatics.pdf', 'page': 3, 'start_index': 2000, 'chunk_index': 13}), Document(page_content='Tracking”). This is one weakness of our research, and future \r\nwork should further explore people’s reasons for deciding \r\nnot to return to tracking. \r\nDEVELOPMENT OF A LIVED INFORMATICS MODEL \r\nBased on results of our survey and interviews, we develop a \r\nnew model of personal informatics reflecting a “lived \r\ninformatics” [34] view of usage. The stage-based model [21] \r\nassumes a desire for action, which we believe corresponds to \r\nthe behavior change nature of the model but does not \r\nencompass self-tracking motivated for other reasons. \r\nFurthermore, Li et al.’s model describes people switching to \r\na new tool when their current tool does not meet their \r\ninformation needs [21]. We have found that people’s reasons \r\nfor switching tools are more varied. The prior models also do \r\nnot describe the ways in which and reasons why people lapse \r\nin their tracking or stop entirely [11]. We integrate lapses and \r\nresumption into our model, which appears in Figure 2. \r\nDeciding to Track \r\nWe divide the preparation stage of Li et al.’s model [21] into \r\ntwo stages: deciding and selecting. The deciding stage refers \r\nto the decision to track personal data. This stage mirrors the \r\nprecontemplation and contemplation stages of the TTM for \r\npeople with a behavior change goal [32]. People decide to \r\ntrack for varied reasons, including to see other’s activity, to \r\nshare activity with others, to receive rewards, or curiosity. \r\nPeople can decide to track having never tracked before, or \r\ncan return to tracking from a prior experience. \r\nDomain Demographics \r\nTemporal use \r\n(avg # tools) Tools Mentioned \r\nPhysical \r\nActivity \r\nN=105: 44 F, \r\n60 M, 1 FTM \r\nAge: avg 31.47, \r\nmin 19, max 63 \r\n93 current (1.25) \r\nFitBit (19), MapMyRun (18), \r\nRunKeeper (13), MyFitnessPal (12), \r\nNike+ (10) \r\n53 stopped (1.16) \r\nRunKeeper (12), MapMyRun (9), \r\nFitBit (8), Nike+ (8), \r\nMyFitnessPal (4) \r\nFinances \r\nN=99: 46 F, 52 M, \r\n1 FTM \r\nAge: avg 33.46, \r\nmin 19, max 70', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/raw_data/A Lived Informatics Model of Personal Informatics.pdf', 'page': 3, 'start_index': 0, 'chunk_index': 14}), Document(page_content="96 current (1.58) Spreadsheets (60), Credit Card \r\ntools (34), Mint (34), Quicken (11) \r\n43 stopped (1.07) \r\nQuicken (21), Mint (8), \r\nSpreadsheets (7), \r\nCredit Card tools (7) \r\nLocation \r\nN=83: 36 F, 46 M, \r\n1 no answer \r\nAge: avg 30.75, \r\nmin 19, max 70 \r\n80 current (1.86) \r\nFacebook (56), Instagram (23), \r\nGoogle Latitude (19), Twitter (17), \r\nFoursquare (16), FindMyFriends (8)\r\n44 stopped (1.29) \r\nFoursquare (24), Facebook (9), \r\nGoogle Latitude (7), Instagram (5), \r\nTwitter (5), FindMyFriends (4) \r\nTable 1.

This is sometimes minimal or coupled with \r\nthe decision to track (e.g., when someone received a tracking \r\ntool as a gift and decides to use it). This decision can also be \r\ndifficult and require extensive comparison of tools (e.g., \r\nonline, through brief use). Tool selection can depend on \r\nfeatures, aesthetics, and convenience, and choices can be \r\nlimited by the tracker’s mobile platform or budget. \r\nTracking and Acting \r\nChoe [7] and Whooley et al. [41] suggest self-trackers learn \r\nabout their behavior and make changes to their practices while \r\nthey collect and integrate data (e.g., reflection-in-action [36]). \r\nWe define this practice of tracking and acting as the ongoing \r\nprocess of collecting, integrating, and reflecting. These three \r\nactivities are distinct and do have data dependencies, but in \r\ncontrast to Li et al.’s model [21] we do not separate them into \r\nstages. These activities can and do occur simultaneously. \r\nLapsing \r\nThe lapsing stage occurs when someone stops actively using \r\na self-tracking tool. Lapsing typically begins with barriers to \r\ncollection, but can also be caused by barriers to integration \r\nor reflection [21]. We later describe four categories of lapses: \r\nforgetting, upkeep, skipping, and suspending. For some, a \r\nlapse is a temporary break in tracking, while others do not \r\nreturn to tracking and have no intention to track again. \r\nResuming \r\nShort-term lapses (e.g., forgetting to bring a pedometer on a \r\nweekend trip) often are followed by a quick resumption of \r\ntracking. In these cases, someone may not revisit their \r\ndecision to track and the selection of a tool. \r\nAfter a longer lapse (e.g., stopping tracking for months), the \r\nself-tracker may not necessarily resume collecting more data. \r\nInstead, they may resume integrating or reflecting upon their \r\nprevious data, deciding later whether more collection is', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/raw_data/A Lived Informatics Model of Personal Informatics.pdf', 'page': 4, 'start_index': 0, 'chunk_index': 16}), Document(page_content='needed. This decision varies by the tracker and the domain. \r\nMODEL STAGES ACROSS DOMAINS \r\nIn this section, we discuss how our model describes \r\nself-tracking across domains. We report on themes present \r\nacross all three domains we studied, noting exceptions \r\nspecific to particular tracking domains. We believe the \r\nsimilarities in tracking experiences across domains indicate \r\nthe potential for the model’s applicability to other domains. \r\nThis section contains quotes from our 168 survey and 22 \r\ninterview participants. We quote participants as p##, where \r\np1-p22 were interviewed and p16-p184 were surveyed. \r\nNote this means that p16-p22 completed both. \r\nDifferent Motivations for Deciding to Track \r\nMost models of personal informatics and self-monitoring \r\ndescribe the practices of people who engage in self-tracking \r\nwith a specific behavior change goal in mind [1,21,32]. \r\nAlthough this describes much self-tracking behavior, people \r\nalso begin and continue to self-track for reasons not well \r\ndescribed by these models. We describe three classes of \r\nself-tracker motivations: behavior change, instrumentation, \r\nand curiosity. These initial motivations inform how \r\nself-trackers select, use, and lapse in tool usage. \r\nBehavior Change Goals \r\nPrior work has described how behavior change goals can \r\nmotivate someone to start tracking [15,19,22,34]. Personal \r\ninformatics tools support principle and program-level goals \r\nin Powers’ categorization of goals [31]. Principle-level goals \r\nare relatively abstract and ideal guiding principles that one \r\ntries to attain, such as goals described by p5 “get in better \r\nshape”, p86 “to have more control over my finances”, and 92 \r\nothers. Program goals are more specific and actionable \r\n(e.g., p89 “get[ting] out of debt”, 39 others). We identified \r\n48 financial trackers motivated to receive a financial touch \r\n[20], such as p90 “just wanted a clearer snapshot of my', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/raw_data/A Lived Informatics Model of Personal Informatics.pdf', 'page': 4, 'start_index': 1986, 'chunk_index': 17}), Document(page_content='finances.” We believe such trackers intend to change their', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/raw_data/A Lived Informatics Model of Personal Informatics.pdf', 'page': 4, 'start_index': 3932, 'chunk_index': 18}), Document(page_content='48 financial trackers motivated to receive a financial touch \r\n[20], such as p90 “just wanted a clearer snapshot of my \r\nfinances.” We believe such trackers intend to change their \r\nbehavior if they notice something they find concerning, such \r\nas p164 “[I] wanted to know if I should cut down on anything.” \r\nEven when people track to aid in behavior change, they \r\nsometimes track primarily to gain motivation or increase \r\ntheir accountability, rather than for insights or awareness of \r\ntheir own behavior [2]. p72 started tracking “because I felt I \r\nneeded to get more motivation for my fitness”, while p73 \r\ntracked finances “to be accountable with how I spend my \r\nmoney” (mentioned by 11 and 2 others respectively). Support \r\nfor these goals may have different design requirements than \r\nsupporting informational goals. Adding features that let \r\npeople share progress may create channels for accountability \r\n[27,28], but merely having a record in the tool or online can \r\nalso help motivate people and make them feel accountable to \r\nthe tool [26]. For some people, the record’s support for \r\naccountability is more valuable than insights derived. \r\nFigure 2. Our lived informatics model of personal\r\ninformatics. It includes the process of deciding to track\r\nand selecting tools, tracking and acting as an ongoing\r\nprocess of collection, integration, and reflection, and\r\nlapsing of tracking that may later be resumed. \r\n735\r\nSESSION: PERSUASIVE AND PERSONAL', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/raw_data/A Lived Informatics Model of Personal Informatics.pdf', 'page': 4, 'start_index': 0, 'chunk_index': 19}), Document(page_content='Instrumental Tracking Goals \r\nWe define instrumental tracking as tracking without the goal \r\nof changing a behavior. Instead, the goal is to obtain a record \r\nof a particular behavior, such as going to a particular place or \r\nwatching a particular movie. Some are motivated to track by \r\nrewards that data about their behaviors can unlock, such as \r\ndiscounts or badges [24]. p162 started tracking his physical \r\nactivity because he “got rewards points with my insurance”, \r\nan increasingly common trend for health insurers [29]. \r\nLocation trackers often instrument to achieve social benefits. \r\n35 mentioned tracking to share where they went, including \r\np173 for practical reasons, “I like to let friends know where I \r\nam in case I am in the area” and p42 for social engagement, \r\n“to get likes”. Others were motivated to start tracking to see \r\nwhere others were “my friends had it so I got it too to see \r\nwhere they were” (p107, 19 others). These social motivations \r\noften are related to other goals, such as p82 sharing to inform \r\nfriends: “I ate at this Thai restaurant that I loved, so I wanted \r\nto share it with friends so they could check it out.” \r\nCuriosity \r\nMany people decide to track without any behavioral goal, but \r\nout of curiosity about what it would be like or would offer. \r\nPeople described thinking tracking would be “fun”, “cool”, \r\n“neat”, and wanted to “try it out” (19, 12, 6, 5 people). \r\nCuriosity is often driven by a desire to keep up with new \r\ntechnology, such as p68 trying Quicken because “it seemed \r\nlike the latest way to keep up with my expenses.” Curiosity \r\nalso spread socially, such as for p41 “everyone was using \r\nFoursquare and I thought I’d finally jump on a bandwagon.” \r\nMany phones and computers include self-tracking programs \r\nby default, such as Google Now, Apple HealthKit, and \r\nQuicken. People also start tracking because they receive apps \r\nand devices as gifts (10 people), they were free (7 people),', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/raw_data/A Lived Informatics Model of Personal Informatics.pdf', 'page': 5, 'start_index': 0, 'chunk_index': 20}), Document(page_content='or their “phone asked if I wanted to”, referring to the GPS \r\ntracking permission models of many common phone apps \r\n(p63, 11 others). These events often make people curious \r\nenough to start tracking, such as for p150: “it was offered \r\nfree of charge so I thought I’d give it a try.” \r\nDifferences by Domain \r\nThe prevalence of tracking motivations varies by domain. \r\nBehavior change goals were common reasons for physical \r\nactivity or financial tracking (82% and 73% of trackers), \r\nwhile instrumental tracking was a major motivator for \r\nlocation trackers (67% of trackers). Curiosity was prevalent \r\nacross all three domains, but was mentioned by more \r\nlocation trackers (10%, 6%, and 20% of physical activity, \r\nfinances, and location trackers). Our participants used \r\nprimarily socially-oriented location tracking tools. We expect \r\ngoals of self-oriented location trackers (e.g., location diaries) \r\nwould be more similar to physical activity or financial trackers. \r\nSelecting Tools to Support Tracking Motivation \r\nRooksby et al. describe reasons why self-trackers pick tools, \r\nincluding recommendations, reading media articles, and online \r\nreviews [34]. We note the same practices. Recommendations \r\nfrom friends (28 people) or family and significant others \r\n(9 people) were the most common means of selection. \r\n10 people mentioned online reviews, such as p7 “It was the \r\nfirst result on Amazon, and it had good reviews”. \r\nTrackers motivated by behavior change try to select \r\napplications with features that best support their goals [16]. \r\np177 chose RunKeeper because it integrated with another \r\ntool he was already using: “it works well… with my other \r\napp… Nexercise.” p78 needed a specific feature, “I wanted \r\nto be able to download and import my bank statements so I \r\ncould keep track of my spending”, and decided Quicken best \r\nfit his needs. Behavior change trackers typically do \r\nsubstantial background research when selecting a tool, such', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/raw_data/A Lived Informatics Model of Personal Informatics.pdf', 'page': 5, 'start_index': 1968, 'chunk_index': 21}), Document(page_content='could keep track of my spending”, and decided Quicken best \r\nfit his needs. Behavior change trackers typically do \r\nsubstantial background research when selecting a tool, such \r\nas looking at many reviews “I read a lot of tech blogs… \r\nFitBit has consistently gotten really good reviews” (p19, \r\n7 others). p5 and 2 others described seeking out opinions on \r\ntools from her social network: “a lot of times if I know that \r\nI’m looking for something new, I will quite often ask around \r\non Facebook and such, ‘has anyone tried this’?” \r\nInstrumental trackers look to maximize benefit they receive \r\nfrom a tool based on social influence or potential rewards. \r\nFor instrumental trackers who are tracking to see others or \r\nfor others to see, selecting a tool is dependent on what tools \r\nothers use. Location tagging on large social networks is \r\npopular because “everyone else is using it” (p57) and it is \r\neasy to engage with a large audience. People also look to \r\nmaximize the rewards they receive, such as selecting a FitBit \r\nbecause it is supported by a work wellness program (p18). \r\nTrackers motivated by curiosity often do not actively think \r\nabout selecting a tool, instead beginning to use whatever tool \r\nprompted their initial curiosity. Frequent media references \r\nled p154 to be curious about self-tracking: “I started using \r\nApple HealthKit since there was hype in the media about how \r\ngreat this app is”, but it did not live up to his expectations \r\n“I used it for less than a week and was not impressed.” \r\nUsing Tools for Value and Insight \r\nPeople with varied tracking motivations use tools differently \r\nduring the collection, integration, and reflection stages of the \r\npersonal informatics model [21], which we define as the \r\npractice of tracking and acting. This section separately \r\ndiscusses how people collect, integrate, and reflect on data, \r\nbut we reiterate that these processes occur simultaneously in', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/raw_data/A Lived Informatics Model of Personal Informatics.pdf', 'page': 5, 'start_index': 0, 'chunk_index': 22}), Document(page_content="practice. We report on and discuss differences in usage in \r\nboth self-tracking data and self-tracker motivation. \r\nCollection \r\nWe notice a trend toward long-term use of current tracking \r\ntools (Figure 3), but people appear to abandon location and \r\nphysical activity tracking tools more quickly than financial \r\ntracking tools (45% and 44% of people abandoned tools for \r\nlocation and physical activity within three months, versus \r\n26% for financial tools). Respondents also used location \r\ntracking tools less frequently than other tools (Figure 4a), \r\nand many respondents logged physical activity every day \r\n(Figure 4b). We infer that people have a daily or weekly habit \r\nof collecting their finances or physical activity, while \r\n736\r\nUBICOMP '15, SEPTEMBER 7–11, 2015, OSAKA, JAPAN", metadata={'source': 'data/paper/raw_data/A Lived Informatics Model of Personal Informatics.pdf', 'page': 5, 'start_index': 1941, 'chunk_index': 23}), Document(page_content='location tracking appeared more intermittent. However, \r\nmany participants reported having not used their tracking \r\ntools in the past week (24%, 26%, and 36% of physical \r\nactivity, finances, and location trackers). \r\nPeople who track to support behavior change tend to collect \r\ndata frequently, such as p21 “the FitBit’s on every day, \r\nalmost 24 hours”. Behavior change trackers were bothered \r\nwhen records were not accurate “I had a few accounts that I \r\ncould never get added properly… it was an inaccurate \r\npicture of our finances” (p19). p162 wanted credit for his \r\nactivity “[my app] wouldn’t always acknowledge when I was \r\nat the gym”, a common problem in prior work [8,16]. \r\nFor people trying to maintain a level of activity, accuracy \r\nwas less important. p11 noted “I do keep an eye on trends. If \r\nI’m trending negative, or trending positive in my accounts”, \r\nand emphasized trying to keep his spending constant. \r\nKay et al. previously noted trends matter more than accuracy \r\nfor people who were trying to maintain, not lose, weight [19]. \r\nFinancial trackers typically have behavior change motivations, \r\nand their usage of tools reflects this. 45% of financial \r\ntrackers reported using their current tool for at least two \r\nyears, with 73% reporting having used their tool within the \r\npast week. 63% of our financial trackers were currently using \r\nspreadsheets, which require substantial manual entry. This \r\nlevel of sustained and frequent engagement with financial \r\ntracking is notable given the high burdens of data entry \r\nrelative to our other domains. Kaye et al. suggest people are \r\nwilling to exert this effort to manage their finances and often \r\nprefer it to using financial aggregation tools [20]. \r\nInstrumental trackers tend to engage in tracking when the \r\nbenefits of doing so exceed the costs, such as the effort to \r\nrecord activities or to remember to charge and wear a device. \r\nFor p143, this meant tracking when he was somewhere', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/raw_data/A Lived Informatics Model of Personal Informatics.pdf', 'page': 6, 'start_index': 0, 'chunk_index': 24}), Document(page_content="interesting: “to brag about a cool place I’m at like \r\nDisneyworld.” p18 was motivated to track by the incentives \r\nof her health insurance plan, and she continues because \r\n“I get rewards [from my health insurance plan] for making \r\nso many steps a day and for logging my food daily.” \r\nThe frequency with which curiosity-driven trackers collect \r\ndata is inconsistent, and depends on how compelling they \r\nfind the data they track. Many curiosity-motivated trackers \r\nwill discover another value to tracking and increase their tool \r\nuse, such as p85, who started location tracking because it \r\n“was a trendy thing to do, but later on I've realized its \r\nbenefits.” p132 started tracking physical activity because an \r\napp came preinstalled on his phone, and later realized the app \r\nwas “an ideal tool to record my physical activity.” \r\nLocation trackers tended to have motivations that were \r\ninstrumental or curious, use their tracking tools less \r\nfrequently (only 49% report tracking in the past week), and \r\nabandon tracking most quickly (18% of past trackers used \r\ntheir tool for less than one week). We note that 75% of \r\ncurrent location trackers report using their tools for at least a \r\nyear, which we believe coincides with the feature’s inclusion \r\nin popular social network applications. \r\nIntegration \r\nPeople integrate self-tracking data to help make sense of it. \r\nIntegration can be trivial or time-consuming, depending on \r\nhow much responsibility the person bears in preparing the \r\ncollected data for reflection [21]. Many of the tools used by \r\nour self-trackers do not require integration, such as for \r\nMapMyRun, “there is this whole dashboard on the website” \r\n(p16). For some behavior change tools, such as Mint, the \r\npurpose of the application is integration: “I thought it would \r\nbe beneficial to have all my finances in one place and see \r\nwhat I spend my money on” (p178). \r\nFor instrumental trackers, it is important the data they track", metadata={'source': 'data/paper/raw_data/A Lived Informatics Model of Personal Informatics.pdf', 'page': 6, 'start_index': 1981, 'chunk_index': 25}), Document(page_content='be beneficial to have all my finances in one place and see \r\nwhat I spend my money on” (p178). \r\nFor instrumental trackers, it is important the data they track \r\nintegrate into the system that provides the corresponding \r\nbenefits. Tracking location for social reasons is only valuable \r\nif it the people a tracker cares about can see it. For p6, it was \r\nimportant to select a tracker that integrates with his insurance \r\nprogram. He describes the integration process: “FitBit sends \r\n[my data] to the health plan, then you can view it through the \r\nhealth plan’s app to track your progress.” Trackers \r\nmotivated by curiosity in our study did not describe any \r\n(a) \r\n(b) \r\nFigure 4.

We note some respondents across all domains \r\nmade a daily habit out of reviewing their data (20%, 12%, \r\nand 4% of physical activity, financial, and location trackers \r\nreported reviewing their data every day for the past 7 days). \r\nBehavior change oriented trackers regularly reviewed their \r\ndata, such as p22 “I usually log on to Mint almost every day. \r\nSometimes I check a couple times a day when I am expecting \r\na big expense”. Physical activity trackers reviewed their data \r\nmost frequently (e.g., “I guess I would check in pretty much \r\ndaily on how many steps I had taken, maybe 2 or 3 times a \r\nday” p17), while aggregation across a week or month may be \r\nenough for to receive value from financial data. \r\nInstrumental and curiosity-driven trackers tend not to \r\nfrequently review or reflect on their data, such as p2 “I would \r\nsay a couple of times a week. Not that frequently”. For \r\ninstrumental-motivated trackers, the act of tracking is more \r\nimportant than looking back later, “it’s just about entering it \r\nin that moment” (p16). \r\nFour Categories of Lapsing \r\n15%, 14%, and 17% of physical activity, finances, and location \r\ntrackers identified as current trackers despite having not used their \r\ntool for a month or more. We believe people still see themselves \r\nas trackers and participate in the underlying behavior. p30 \r\nidentified he was no longer tracking, and when asked why he', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/raw_data/A Lived Informatics Model of Personal Informatics.pdf', 'page': 7, 'start_index': 0, 'chunk_index': 27}), Document(page_content='stopped tracking, he stated, “technically, I haven’t [stopped] – I \r\nam just in between usages…” \r\nParticipants in our study described four types of lapses: \r\nforgetting, upkeep, skipping, and suspending. We discuss the \r\ncauses of each of these lapses and how they manifest. \r\nLapsing may be intentional or unintentional, and may or may \r\nnot lead to stopping entirely. \r\nForgetting. People do not always remember to use their \r\ntracking tools, or cannot use them, regardless of their original \r\nmotivations for tracking. p13 states she “never purposefully \r\nstopped using” her FitBit, but she has “left it in a coworkers \r\ncar after happy hour once. That was embarrassing.” \r\nSubstantial personal informatics research has explored how \r\nto reduce the likelihood of forgetting, including providing \r\nreminders [4] and automatically sensing behaviors that are \r\ntypically journaled [33,39]. \r\nAlthough forgetting typically results in a short-term lapse, \r\npeople may decide that tracking is not worth the trouble after \r\nforgetting several times. p177 stopped using RunKeeper, \r\nexplaining: “[I] haven’t used it as much as I would want to. \r\nI guess I forget to use it.” p3 mentions falling out of the habit: \r\n“I just didn’t make it a habit and then kind of forgot about it.” \r\nUpkeep. Devices and tools often require maintenance to \r\ncontinue tracking. The simplest example is charging the \r\nbattery of a wearable device. 8 people mentioned forgetting \r\nto charge their devices, leaving them without tracking for an \r\nextended period of time. When talking about her FitBit, p19 \r\nsaid, “right now it’s out of battery so I haven’t used it all \r\nweek.” Although she intends to continue using it, she often \r\nneeds a reminder to resume tracking: “I’ll probably charge it \r\ntonight, just because we’re talking about it.” \r\nUpkeep becomes a barrier to success for behavior change \r\ntrackers. p19, who used spreadsheets to track her finances,', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/raw_data/A Lived Informatics Model of Personal Informatics.pdf', 'page': 7, 'start_index': 1938, 'chunk_index': 28}), Document(page_content='said “we just kind of stopped updating it because it was too \r\nmuch work to keep up to date”, with p174 adding that he', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/raw_data/A Lived Informatics Model of Personal Informatics.pdf', 'page': 7, 'start_index': 3879, 'chunk_index': 29}), Document(page_content="trackers. p19, who used spreadsheets to track her finances, \r\nsaid “we just kind of stopped updating it because it was too \r\nmuch work to keep up to date”, with p174 adding that he \r\n“grew tired of managing it.” For curiosity-driven trackers, \r\nupkeep becomes a barrier to usage. p20 wanted to use the \r\nlifelogging app Saga, “It would log everything… that sounds \r\nexactly like I’d wanted”, but gave up quickly because “I felt \r\nit was eating too much of my battery.” \r\nSkipping. People make the decision not to log everything \r\nthey track. Sometimes, they already know the data and do not \r\nsee the benefit: “I run this one little loop that I already know \r\nthe distance, so I don’t really bother with keeping track on \r\nthe app” (p11). p20 mentions that some locations represent \r\nevents too private to record: “some of these appointments are \r\npersonal private things… ‘do I check in publicly so that I can \r\nkeep track?’” The desire to maintain a complete record is in \r\ntension with privacy in systems that emphasize sharing. \r\n(a) \r\n(b)\r\nFigure 5.

People temporarily suspend tracking because \r\nthey do not need or want to track a time period. p122 stopped \r\nusing Nike+ because of the holidays: “the holidays and \r\nfamily visiting me has stopped me from using it.” p12 does \r\nnot food journal while she is on vacation: “I put [entries] in \r\nMyFitnessPal every single day, except if I’m on a holiday or \r\nsomething.” p6 notes that he has “taken breaks during the \r\nwinter season from [activity] tracking.” p180 describes \r\ntaking a break from Mint and later returning: “because I \r\ndidn’t really have the financial need for it at the time—not much \r\nmoney was coming in. But I recently started using it again”. \r\nSuspending tracking differs from suspending the activity that \r\nis being tracked. Examples of suspending activities include \r\ninjuries (e.g., “I got injured and stopped running” p106, \r\n“I stopped running due to knee injury” p16) or changing life \r\nhabits “I travel less now” (p46). For these examples, the tracking \r\ntool is no longer relevant to the person. Although these \r\nsuspensions may be temporary and may appear the same from \r\nthe perspective of what data is captured, this distinction is \r\nimportant in how people think about and use their tools. \r\nTransitioning to a New Tool \r\nSelf-trackers regularly transition to new tools. In our survey, \r\n53%, 72%, and 78% of physical activity, finances, and \r\nlocation trackers had used more than one tool. Changes are \r\nsometimes forced by reasons outside of tool selection, such \r\nas changing phones ([34], “I switched mobile platforms” p22, \r\n3 others) or because the tool stopped being supported (e.g., \r\n“Microsoft Money quit supporting their software” p77, 5', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/raw_data/A Lived Informatics Model of Personal Informatics.pdf', 'page': 8, 'start_index': 0, 'chunk_index': 31}), Document(page_content='others). We focus on people choosing to stop using a tool and \r\nbeginning to use another, with or without a lapse in between.\r\nAs suggested by Li et al., behavior change motivated trackers \r\nswitch to tools that better meet their information needs [21]. \r\n25 people described switching to a new tool that was \r\n“better”, such as p186 switching from Quicken “someone \r\nrecommended MoneyDance and I liked it a lot better” and \r\np95 from RunKeeper “found a better alternative \r\n(MapMyRun).” People often describe what is better about a \r\nnew tool in terms of features (e.g., “I wanted a more robust \r\napp option that would keep my weight and body \r\nmeasurements” p47, 12 others), ease of use (e.g., “I like my \r\nonline banking app better and it is easier” p72), or accuracy \r\n(e.g., “I upgraded to a smartphone with data that could track \r\nmy actual location and track more accurately” p54). \r\nTrackers motivated by behavior change often use and \r\ncompare multiple tools at once, then decide what tool they \r\nprefer. When p5 decided to try switching from an analog \r\npedometer to a FitBit, she wore both of them: “I put them \r\nboth on to see what the FitBit would be like and compare \r\nthem” and later returned the FitBit because it was “way off in \r\ncomparison.” p121 started using their bank’s tracking tools \r\n“to compare it to other software tools”, but later decided that \r\nother tools were better and stopped using her bank tools. \r\nFor instrumental trackers, tool switching often occurs when \r\na new tool offers more benefits. p57 switched from location \r\ntagging on Facebook to Twitter and Instagram because \r\n“everyone moved on to other social media platforms… so I \r\nfollowed those trends instead.” p6 described using multiple \r\npedometers at once, because his health plan would “pick the \r\nbest numbers from all of those”, before settling on the one \r\nthat gave the largest rewards. \r\nWe did not observe many instances of curiosity-motivated', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/raw_data/A Lived Informatics Model of Personal Informatics.pdf', 'page': 8, 'start_index': 2001, 'chunk_index': 32}), Document(page_content='best numbers from all of those”, before settling on the one \r\nthat gave the largest rewards. \r\nWe did not observe many instances of curiosity-motivated \r\ntrackers switching tools, perhaps because use of one tool \r\ntended to satisfy their curiosity. After trying tracking, some \r\nof these trackers developed behavior change goals and \r\nswitched tools that better matched their new goals. \r\nStopping Tracking \r\nAlthough extended or repeated lapses often lead people to \r\nstop tracking, people also stop tracking for other reasons. \r\nSome trackers motivated by behavior change stop tracking \r\nwhen they successfully change the behavior, and move on to \r\nmaintaining their desired behavior [32]. p142 and 2 others \r\nstopped tracking because they “met my weight goal.” \r\nFor others, the behavior change is no longer necessary, “I’m \r\nnot as financially strapped as when I was using Mint, so \r\nthat’s a big reason why I stopped using it” (p15). \r\nInstrumental trackers stop tracking when the benefits from \r\ninstrumenting fade or are withdrawn. p164 stopped using \r\nFoursquare because “the possibility of deals wasn’t enticing \r\nenough.” For many social-oriented location trackers, this \r\noccurs when others stop using the tool: “everyone else stopped \r\nusing it” (p170, 10 others). However, some people who start \r\nas instrumental trackers find other benefits for tracking. \r\nAlthough p18 would not have purchased her FitBit except \r\nfor her work wellness program, she said she would continue \r\nto use it if the wellness program no longer supported it. \r\nSome motivated to track by curiosity stop when that curiosity \r\nfades. p109 stopped using Foursquare when “the novelty \r\nwore off” and p72 stopped using Google Latitude because “it \r\nwas boring.” p27 and 2 others described starting to track \r\nbecause they “like new technology”, and may have moved \r\nonto a new curiosity when the novelty of the tool faded. \r\nStopping tracking is not necessarily a permanent decision,', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/raw_data/A Lived Informatics Model of Personal Informatics.pdf', 'page': 8, 'start_index': 0, 'chunk_index': 33}), Document(page_content='and people sometimes return to tracking. Finding a new tool \r\nto integrate with may motivate someone to resume tracking. \r\np20 stopped using Foursquare because there was “less of a \r\nmotivation to check in”, but later resumed because she “got \r\na Pebble and you can check in on Foursquare from your \r\nPebble.” People also return to tools when their goals align \r\nwith what the tools can support. p18 used MyFitnessPal to \r\nhelp her lose weight, lost interest in the tool, and resumed \r\nusing MyFitnessPal to help with weight loss two years later. \r\n739\r\nSESSION: PERSUASIVE AND PERSONAL', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/raw_data/A Lived Informatics Model of Personal Informatics.pdf', 'page': 8, 'start_index': 1970, 'chunk_index': 34}), Document(page_content='DISCUSSION \r\nOur revised model of personal informatics offers guidance and \r\ndesign challenges for the personal informatics community. \r\nSome guidelines are consistent with those suggested by \r\nRooksby et al., including to consider the agency of people \r\nand how they want to self-track [34]. We supplement these \r\nguidelines by recommending that designers plan for lapse \r\nand resumption, consider people migrating between tools, \r\nand support people adjusting their tracking goals. \r\nReturning to Tracking with the Same Tool after a Lapse \r\nIt is unclear how personal informatics tools should behave \r\nwhen someone decides to resume use after a lapse. A \r\nperson’s historical data may be helpful for setting new goals, \r\nsuch as defining a new budget based on their previous \r\nspending habits. However, seeing historical data (and \r\npotential failures surfaced) may be demotivating for someone \r\nlooking to resume use of a calorie-tracking app to lose weight. \r\nHistorical data offers opportunities to bootstrap the data \r\ncollection process, but its use requires careful consideration. \r\nSome self-tracking tools passively collect information for as \r\nlong as the tool is not disabled or uninstalled (e.g., Apple \r\nHealthKit, Moves, Mint). Although someone may not look \r\nat their data for months or even years, the tool continues to \r\ncollect and store their information. It is unclear what, if \r\nanything, the tool should do with this historical data when \r\nsomeone resumes using the tool after an extended lapse. \r\nAlthough prior research has considered the challenge of \r\npresenting a large amount of personal data in an easily \r\nconsumable manner [3,15], it remains unclear how to \r\nsummarize this data based on the reason the person resumed \r\ntracking. Furthermore, perhaps the passively collected data \r\nshould not be summarized at all. Instead, the person may \r\nwant start over with a clean slate, and looking at their \r\nprevious data may create a negative reaction if they view', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/raw_data/A Lived Informatics Model of Personal Informatics.pdf', 'page': 9, 'start_index': 0, 'chunk_index': 35}), Document(page_content='their previous tracking experience as a failure. \r\nEffective Migration between Tools \r\nWhen describing design choices for assistive technology, \r\nDawe notes the difficulty in replacing broken or outdated \r\ntechnology, particularly with regards to cost [13]. Although \r\nmany tools are free, some self-trackers are concerned with \r\nthe cost of others. Loss can cause a lapse when someone \r\ncannot afford a replacement, such as FitBit wearer p155 \r\n“it got lost or stolen and I didn’t want to spend the money to \r\nreplace [it]” and Quicken user p53 “it costs money, and I \r\nrealized I could do everything I wanted with Excel.” More \r\ncommonly, people change their motivation and needs for \r\ntracking, such that tools no longer support the new needs. \r\nAlthough some self-trackers are not concerned with \r\nabandoning tools and the data they have collected, others \r\navoid switching tools, even when a better tool exists. p11 \r\ndescribes why he avoids switching tools: \r\nI try to avoid it as much as possible… When you transition from \r\ntools, there’s a lot of transaction costs in terms of switching \r\nbetween one and the other. You just have to get your profile set \r\nup again, you have to learn to interact with a tool. There’s \r\npotential data loss. I don’t know if that matters, sometimes it \r\ndoes, but usually it’s something that I just kind of gave up on.\r\nThe overhead of setting up a profile, learning a new interface, \r\nand losing his data were too much for p11 to consider \r\nswitching tools. While he desires other features, saying \r\n“I want to have an aggregate sense of how many miles I’ve \r\nrun for the past three months”, he is unwilling to switch to a \r\nnew tool and lose all of his built-up knowledge.

Others did not \r\nfind such alternative benefits. This suggests that designers \r\nmay be able to do more to help people see benefits in \r\ncontinuing to track. This might include realizing the value of \r\ntracking to support behavior change goals they already have, \r\nor even setting new goals. For example, an app that someone \r\nstarts to use out of curiosity regarding how active they are \r\ncould illustrate benefits achieved by others who started from \r\nthe same activity level and walked a bit more each week. \r\nIn other cases, data from personal informatics applications \r\nmay prompt people to question their behavior. For example, \r\nsomeone who tracks their location to share with friends or \r\nreceive discounts might receive a badge for eating out often, \r\nor realize they check-in at restaurants much more than their \r\nfriends, and wonder how much they could save by cooking.\r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWe offer a model of personal informatics informed by the \r\nperspective of lived informatics, expanding upon prior \r\nmodels based primarily in behavior change and maintenance. \r\nWe identify three initial motivations for tracking: the desire \r\nto change behavior, instrumenting for rewards or social \r\nengagement, and curiosity regarding data and habits. \r\nOur model captures the practices of self-trackers with such \r\ndiverse goals, offers a better understanding of how they use \r\nself-tracking tools, and helps surface relatively unexplored', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/raw_data/A Lived Informatics Model of Personal Informatics.pdf', 'page': 9, 'start_index': 0, 'chunk_index': 37}), Document(page_content="challenges for future designers and researchers. \r\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \r\nWe thank Kelly Campbell, Monica Caraway, Season Dai, Yoanna \r\nDosouto, Nicole Fugere, Coimbra Jackson, Bradley Jacobson, \r\nChuck Johnston, Kim Lambert, Alex Pease, Sreedev Sidharthan, \r\nMaria Suhardi, Megan Taylor, and Frank Xu for their \r\ncontributions through survey design and participant interviews. \r\nWe also thank Elena Agapie, Elizabeth Bales, Lucas Franco \r\nColusso, Felicia Cordeiro, and Ravi Karkar for early feedback and \r\ndesign of visuals.
