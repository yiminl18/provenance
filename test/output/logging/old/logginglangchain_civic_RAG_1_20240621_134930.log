This property of personal informatics systems opens several 
opportunities for research and applications. Many existing 
technologies are capable of collecting various types of 
personal information, and researchers in ubiquitous 
computing and lifelogging are developing new collection 
tools. How can personal informatics systems leverage these 
new technologies to inform people about different facets of 
their lives? What would visualizations that show multiple 
facets of people's lives look like? How should they be 
designed so that non-experts (most people) can gain 
insights about their lives?
Limitations of the Survey and Model
We recruited participants from a blog dedicated to personal 
informatics, a blog about general information visualization, 
and two personal informatics web sites, so most survey 
participants were familiar with personal informatics. Since 
even these interested users had plenty of problems with
different systems, we suspect that the problems they 
encountered may be a subset of problems that common
users may experience. We think it would be interesting to 
study users with little or no prior experience with personal 
informatics systems to find specific barriers that they may 
encounter.
CASE STUDIES
Having identified the stages model, the properties of the 
stages, and the barriers experienced within the stages, we 
can now apply the model to analyze personal informatics 
systems. In this section, we evaluate existing personal 
informatics systems to demonstrate the use of the model. In 
consideration of space, we only highlight some aspects of 
each system. We describe barriers that users may encounter 
and suggest potential solutions to explore further.

 section, the survey asked what patterns, trends, and 
surprises participants found from reflecting on their 
information. The survey ended with demographics 
questions (e.g., gender, age range, marital status, 
employment, education, and technology use). The 
following are example questions from the survey1:
• How difficult is it to collect this personal information?
• What was your initial motivation to reflect on this 
collected personal information?
• What patterns (repeating events) have you found when 
exploring this collected personal information?
Participants
We recruited participants from a blog dedicated to personal 
informatics (http://quantifiedself.com), a blog about general 
information visualization (http://flowingdata.com), and

forums at two personal informatics web sites
(http://slifelabs.com and http://moodjam.org). We chose 
these web sites because their readers and users were more 
likely to have used one or more personal informatics 
systems. Survey participants were entered into a raffle for a 
$25 Amazon gift certificate. We interviewed a subset of 
these participants using instant messenger to collect 
additional details about their responses. Interviewees 
received an additional $10 Amazon gift certificate. 
We had 68 people complete the surveys, and 11 agreed to 
participate in the follow-up interviews. 37 participants were 
male. Ages ranged from 18 to 64 with a median age range 
of 26 to 30. About half had graduate degrees and another 
half were in college. More than half worked full-time. 
Participants were technologically savvy. 90% of 
participants used email or instant messenger daily to 
communicate. 60% of them used social networking sites 
daily. Most read news websites and blogs, ordered products 
online, and managed bills and bank accounts online.

depending on his hypotheses (e.g., what is the effect of 
caffeine consumption on my sleep patterns?).
The iterative property of personal informatics systems 
suggests that systems should be flexible to support users' 
changing information needs. Systems could be flexible by 
1) supporting importing data from other systems, as well as, 
exporting to other systems; and 2) supporting different 
kinds of information. Since tool changes may render 
previously collected data useless, systems should support 
rapid iteration, so that users can quickly hone in on the 
questions they want to answer and select the appropriate 
tools to collect the necessary information.
User-driven vs. System-driven 
Each stage can be classified as user-driven, system-driven, 
or a combination of both. When a stage is user-driven, the 
user is responsible for the activity in the stage. In the 
Preparation stage, the user decides what type of information 
to collect and what tools to use. User-driven collection is 
when users record information on paper or enter 
information into a spreadsheet, an application, or a website 
form. User-driven integration is when users have to 
transcribe collected information, so that they can reflect on 
it. In the Reflection stage, the user reflects on the 
information without the aid of visualizations or other tools 
for exploring the data. In the Action stage, the user is 
responsible for deciding on actions to take depending on 
their conclusions from the data without aid from the system.
User-driven stages demand time and attention from the 
user. This is problematic when the demand becomes too 
much (e.g., high frequency of collection). There are ways to 
facilitate user-driven stages. For example, systems that use 
user-driven collection can motivate the user to collect the 
information. Hsieh and colleagues [11] have explored this

 used pen and paper because of their flexibility and ease of 
use; people can take them anywhere and they are easily 
accessible when a note needs to be written. This group 
faced a problem in having to transcribe their data to an 
electronic format in order to visualize their data. Some used 
Excel spreadsheets for graphing. Many used existing 
personal informatics web sites for collecting and reflecting 
on various information, such as finance, food consumption, 
mood, and physical activity. Some used physical devices 
such as pedometers, the WiiFit, and a continuous positive 
airway pressure (CPAP) machine for tracking sleep apnea. 
Some activities had an infrastructure that automatically 
records information such as financial transactions, search 
history, and communication tools (e.g., email, instant 
messenger, and IRC), which people later explored for 
personal information. Some with programming 
backgrounds devised their own way of exploring data (e.g., 
statistical packages for analysis, and programming 
languages to organize and cull information).
Reasons
Participants gave several reasons for collecting and 
reflecting on personal information: natural curiosity, 
interest in data, discovery of new tools, suggestion from 
another person, and trigger events.
Some people cited curiosity about themselves prompted 
them to collect personal information. P22 said, “Curiosity: 
Q: how much would I walk if I didn’t ride my bike? A: kind 
of a lot, but not as much as you’d think.” Some people 
identified themselves by their interest in quantitative data. 
Some participants used the terms “data nerd”, “a student of 
information visualization”, and “geekiness” to describe 
themselves. There is also the added value that the data is 
about them. P40 said, “I’m an engineer, so numbers and 
trends and stuff just interest me in general. Plus this data is 
about ME (her emphasis).”

 trends and stuff just interest me in general. Plus this data is 
about ME (her emphasis).”
Finding personal informatics tools also encouraged people 
to start collecting information. P48 said, “I’ve been 
following Nick Felton’s annual reports so when he started 
Daytum, I joined to start tracking which restaurants I ate 
at.” Others cited trigger events, such as problems in 
relationships (P60, P1), sleep patterns (P44), and weight 
(P21, P23, P37). Sometimes, the trigger event is combined 
with an extra push from another person. P49 started
collecting blood sugar level and blood pressure information 
because of “a doctor’s recommendation (new medical issue, 
new medications).”
STAGES AND BARRIERS
We will now introduce the stage-based model of personal 
informatics that we derived from analysis of the survey and 
interview data. The model is composed of a series of five 
stages (Figure 1): Preparation, Collection, Integration, 
Reflection, and Action. We define each stage and, for each 
one, describe the barriers that participants experienced.
Preparation Stage
The Preparation stage occurs before people start collecting 
personal information. This stage concerns itself with 
people’s motivation to collect personal information, how 
they determine what information they will record, and how 
they will record it.
Barriers in the Preparation stage are related to determining 
what information to collect and what collection tool to use. 
As noted, some people stumble upon tools, which drive 
them to start collecting. However, this becomes a problem 
when the tool does not satisfy their information needs. This 
causes them to switch to another tool, which has two 
negative consequences: 1) they abandon their previous data 
because most systems do not support data exporting, and 2) 
if they can export data, the formats between the applications 
may not be the same. For example, P48 used Google
