 People change their goals and practices over time, which is 
not  well-supported  by  personal  informatics  systems  [22]. 
These changes sometimes lead to selecting a new tool [21]. 
Some people who start without clear goals narrow their data 
collection once they identify actionable goals, moving from 
discovery  phase  to  maintenance  phase  of  reflecting  [22]. 
People also switch tools as their practices evolve over time 
and  what  a  system  supports  does  no  longer  matches  their 
priorities (e.g., a jogger starting to do yoga) [16].

 I try to avoid it as much as possible… When you transition from 
tools,  there’s  a  lot  of  transaction  costs  in  terms  of  switching 
between one and the other. You just have to get your profile set 
up  again,  you  have  to  learn  to  interact  with  a  tool.  There’s

potential data loss. I don’t know if that matters, sometimes it 
does, but usually it’s something that I just kind of gave up on.

 The overhead of setting up a profile, learning a new interface, 
and  losing  his  data  were  too  much  for  p11  to  consider 
switching  tools.  While  he  desires  other  features,  saying 
“I want to have an aggregate sense of how many miles I’ve 
run for the past three months”, he is unwilling to switch to a 
new  tool  and  lose  all  of  his  built-up  knowledge.  Although 
lock-in  may  be  desirable  from  an  application  or  device 
manufacturer’s  point  of  view,  personal  informatics  tools 
could  better  support  their  users  with  designs  that  support 
evolving motivations and feature needs and allow people to 
migrate when the tool no longer best supports their goals.

 Effective Migration between Tools 
When  describing  design  choices  for  assistive  technology, 
Dawe  notes  the  difficulty  in  replacing  broken  or  outdated 
technology, particularly with regards to cost [13]. Although 
many tools are free, some self-trackers are concerned with 
the  cost  of  others.  Loss  can  cause  a  lapse  when  someone 
cannot  afford  a  replacement,  such  as  FitBit  wearer  p155 
“it got lost or stolen and I didn’t want to spend the money to 
replace  [it]”  and  Quicken  user  p53  “it  costs  money,  and  I 
realized I could do everything I wanted with Excel.” More 
commonly,  people  change  their  motivation  and  needs  for 
tracking, such that tools no longer support the new needs. 

Although  some  self-trackers  are  not  concerned  with 
abandoning  tools  and  the  data  they  have  collected,  others 
avoid  switching  tools,  even  when  a  better  tool  exists.  p11 
describes why he avoids switching tools:

 Interview Methods 
After completion of qualitative coding of the survey data, the 
first  two  authors  identified  questions  that  required  further 
in-depth  interviews  to  address.  Of Turkers who indicated in 
the survey that they were willing to be contacted for interviews, 
36 respondents were identified as having representative tracking 
motivations,  behaviors,  and  experiences  and  were  verbose  in 
responses,  of  which  6  responded.  We  supplemented  these 
interviews  with  another  16  recruited  through  university 
mailing lists and posts to social media. These interviewees 
were screened for the same criteria as the Turkers.

 The  full  survey  consisted  of  free  response  questions  about 
each current and previous tool, asking why they started and 
stopped using that tool as appropriate. The first two authors 
affinity diagrammed these responses, identified themes, and 
then separately qualitatively coded the responses, iteratively 
refining codes through discussion.
