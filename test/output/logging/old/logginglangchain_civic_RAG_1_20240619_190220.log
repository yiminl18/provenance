it is too difficult to collect, I have better things to do with

This property of personal informatics systems opens several 
opportunities for research and applications. Many existing 
technologies are capable of collecting various types of 
personal information, and researchers in ubiquitous 
computing and lifelogging are developing new collection 
tools. How can personal informatics systems leverage these 
new technologies to inform people about different facets of 
their lives? What would visualizations that show multiple 
facets of people's lives look like? How should they be 
designed so that non-experts (most people) can gain 
insights about their lives? 
Limitations of the Survey and Model 
We recruited participants from a blog dedicated to personal 
informatics, a blog about general information visualization, 
and two personal informatics web sites, so most survey 
participants were familiar with personal informatics. Since 
even these interested users had plenty of problems with 
different systems, we suspect that the problems they 
encountered may be a subset of problems that common 
users may experience. We think it would be interesting to 
study users with little or no prior experience with personal 
informatics systems to find specific barriers that they may 
encounter. 
CASE STUDIES 
Having identified the stages model, the properties of the 
stages, and the barriers experienced within the stages, we 
can now apply the model to analyze personal informatics 
systems. In this section, we evaluate existing personal 
informatics systems to demonstrate the use of the model. In 
consideration of space, we only highlight some aspects of 
each system. We describe barriers that users may encounter 
and suggest potential solutions to explore further.

 caffeine consumption, meal times, weight) into the reports 
depending on his hypotheses (e.g., what is the effect of 
caffeine consumption on my sleep patterns?). 
The iterative property of personal informatics systems 
suggests that systems should be flexible to support users' 
changing information needs. Systems could be flexible by 
1) supporting importing data from other systems, as well as, 
exporting to other systems; and 2) supporting different 
kinds of information. Since tool changes may render 
previously collected data useless, systems should support 
rapid iteration, so that users can quickly hone in on the 
questions they want to answer and select the appropriate 
tools to collect the necessary information. 
User-driven vs. System-driven  
Each stage can be classified as user-driven, system-driven, 
or a combination of both. When a stage is user-driven, the 
user is responsible for the activity in the stage. In the 
Preparation stage, the user decides what type of information 
to collect and what tools to use. User-driven collection is 
when users record information on paper or enter 
information into a spreadsheet, an application, or a website 
form. User-driven integration is when users have to 
transcribe collected information, so that they can reflect on 
it. In the Reflection stage, the user reflects on the 
information without the aid of visualizations or other tools 
for exploring the data. In the Action stage, the user is 
responsible for deciding on actions to take depending on 
their conclusions from the data without aid from the system. 
User-driven stages demand time and attention from the 
user. This is problematic when the demand becomes too 
much (e.g., high frequency of collection). There are ways to 
facilitate user-driven stages. For example, systems that use 
user-driven collection can motivate the user to collect the 
information. Hsieh and colleagues [11] have explored this 
in the context of experience sampling; they encouraged

 used pen and paper because of their flexibility and ease of 
use; people can take them anywhere and they are easily 
accessible when a note needs to be written. This group 
faced a problem in having to transcribe their data to an 
electronic format in order to visualize their data. Some used 
Excel spreadsheets for graphing. Many used existing 
personal informatics web sites for collecting and reflecting 
on various information, such as finance, food consumption, 
mood, and physical activity. Some used physical devices 
such as pedometers, the WiiFit, and a continuous positive 
airway pressure (CPAP) machine for tracking sleep apnea. 
Some activities had an infrastructure that automatically 
records information such as financial transactions, search 
history, and communication tools (e.g., email, instant 
messenger, and IRC), which people later explored for 
personal 
information. 
Some 
with 
programming 
backgrounds devised their own way of exploring data (e.g., 
statistical packages for analysis, and programming 
languages to organize and cull information). 
Reasons 
Participants gave several reasons for collecting and 
reflecting on personal information: natural curiosity, 
interest in data, discovery of new tools, suggestion from 
another person, and trigger events. 
Some people cited curiosity about themselves prompted 
them to collect personal information. P22 said, “Curiosity: 
Q: how much would I walk if I didn’t ride my bike? A: kind 
of a lot, but not as much as you’d think.” Some people 
identified themselves by their interest in quantitative data. 
Some participants used the terms “data nerd”, “a student of 
information visualization”, and “geekiness” to describe 
themselves. There is also the added value that the data is 
about them. P40 said, “I’m an engineer, so numbers and 
trends and stuff just interest me in general. Plus this data is 
about ME (her emphasis).” 
Finding personal informatics tools also encouraged people

 Notice that the two problems described above could have 
been avoided if we had analyzed IMPACT using the stage-
based model of personal informatics systems earlier in its 
development. Addressing these problems may improve 
users' experience with the system and yield results for the 
use of context in improving monitoring of physical activity. 
DISCUSSION 
We have defined a stage-based model of personal 
informatics systems and identified a comprehensive list of 
the problems that people experience in each of the stages. 
We also described the properties of the stages, which have 
implications in the design of personal informatics systems. 
To build effective personal informatics systems, developers 
and designers should consider the following: 
• Since barriers cascade to later stages, designers and 
developers should consider the system as a whole. This 
holistic approach requires integrating innovations and 
applying lessons from different areas of research, such as 
lifelogging, 
ubiquitous 
computing, 
information 
visualization, and persuasive technologies. 
• Since users iterate in the kinds of questions they ask and 
the tools they use, flexibility within a system and 
between systems is important. Systems should allow 
users to easily change what kind of data they collect 
dependent on their needs and to transfer data from one 
system to another. 
• There are opportunities within each stage to use a 
system-driven approach to reduce the demand on users 
and to make the experience more enjoyable and useful. 
Similarly, a user-driven approach is appealing because it 
leaves control in the hands of the user. Insights from the 
field of human-computer interaction should play a big 
part in the development of mixed-initiative approaches 
for effective personal informatics systems. 
• Currently, most personal informatics systems are uni-
faceted. Participants expressed desire for associating 
different aspects of their lives together. Creating multi-

2024-06-19 19:02:30,855 - root - INFO - final_answer: Statistical methods play a crucial role in processing data from user studies. Commonly utilized statistical methods in this context include descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, and hypothesis testing. Descriptive statistics are employed to summarize and describe the data, allowing researchers to gain a clear understanding of the characteristics of the dataset. On the other hand, inferential statistics enable researchers to make predictions and inferences based on the collected data, aiding in the identification of broader patterns and trends.

Moreover, hypothesis testing is utilized to assess the significance of relationships or variances within the data, helping researchers draw meaningful conclusions from their findings. Statistical methods are essential in analyzing data from user studies as they facilitate the identification of patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset. By leveraging these methods, researchers can gain valuable insights into user behavior and preferences, thereby enabling data-driven decision-making and enhancing the design of personal informatics systems.
