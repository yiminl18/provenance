The  condition \nincurs  high  direct  costs \n(treatment), indirect costs (low productivity) and intangible \ncosts  (quality  of  life)  [18].  OAB  is  a  treatable  condition  as \n70%  of  people  can  be  cured  or  have  their  symptoms \nameliorated  [1].  However,  it  remains  undertreated  due  to \npeople not seeking treatment, lack of proactive questioning \nby physicians and embarrassment [1]. Moreover, traditional \ntreatment requires  motivation  and  involvement, leading to \na  drop  out  whenever  results  are  not  quickly  seen  [10,  56]. \nSmartphones  are  popular  ubiquitous  devices,  with  78%  of \nUK  adults  using  one  [53].  By  often  interacting  with  them, \npeople create a personal bond with the devices [60]', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/extracted_data/A Wee Bit More Interaction: Designing and Evaluating an Overactive Bladder App.txt', 'start_index': 2663, 'chunk_index': 4}), Document(page_content='. Given \ntheir  computing  capabilities,  smartphones  can  recognize \nbehavior patterns and provide real-time interventions [36]. \nAs  people  with  OAB  need  assistance  wherever  they  are,  a \nmobile health (mHealth) app could be an appropriate tool to \nincrease  adherence  to  self-managed  treatment  and  raise \nawareness of symptoms.', metadata={'source': 'data/paper/extracted_data/A Wee Bit More Interaction: Designing and Evaluating an Overactive Bladder App.txt', 'start_index': 3560, 'chunk_index': 5}), Document(page_content='Since the app intends to act as a personal tool, we followed \na  co-design  methodology  to  investigate  what  features \nwould best fit OAB users’ needs. This approach has proved \nsuccessful \nin  health  areas  such  as  falls  [58],  knee \nrehabilitation [2], and cancer treatment [33]. We conducted \nthree  studies  with  key  stakeholders:  people  with  OAB, \ncontinence  specialist  nurses,  and  medical  consultants.  We \nwished  to  answer  the  following  research  questions  (RQ): \nRQ1: What key features should an OAB mHealth app have \nto  support  people  during  self-managed  treatment?

The PFM training consists of performing \ndaily PFM exercises. The bladder training is composed of \nextending  the  time  between  voids  by  applying  urge \nsuppression  techniques  to  try  and  avoid  rushing  to  the \ntoilet  whenever  there  is  an  urge  to  urinate.
