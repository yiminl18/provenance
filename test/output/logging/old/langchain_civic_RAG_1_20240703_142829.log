restricted 
To  ensure 
participation to Turkers who had a task acceptance rate of at 
least  95%  and  had  completed  at  least  1,000  tasks.  We 
surveyed 200 Turkers, compensating each with $0.50 for a 
short  screener  survey  (less  than  2  minutes)  in  which  they 
indicated  all  (if  any)  self-tracking  tools  they  had  used 
previously.  Finally,  Turkers  were  presented  a  short  free 
response question that the first author analyzed for quality, a 
recommended  practice  in  AMT  surveys  [14].  We  rejected 
three  tasks  as  spam:  two  left  the  free  response  question 
effectively  blank  (e.g.,  “N/A”);  one  did  not  enter  a  code 
showing they had completed the survey.

 Interview Methods 
After completion of qualitative coding of the survey data, the 
first  two  authors  identified  questions  that  required  further 
in-depth  interviews  to  address.  Of Turkers who indicated in 
the survey that they were willing to be contacted for interviews, 
36 respondents were identified as having representative tracking 
motivations,  behaviors,  and  experiences  and  were  verbose  in 
responses,  of  which  6  responded.  We  supplemented  these 
interviews  with  another  16  recruited  through  university 
mailing lists and posts to social media. These interviewees 
were screened for the same criteria as the Turkers.
