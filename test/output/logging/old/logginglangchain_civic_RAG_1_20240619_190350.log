This property of personal informatics systems opens several 
opportunities for research and applications. Many existing 
technologies are capable of collecting various types of 
personal information, and researchers in ubiquitous 
computing and lifelogging are developing new collection 
tools. How can personal informatics systems leverage these 
new technologies to inform people about different facets of 
their lives? What would visualizations that show multiple 
facets of people's lives look like? How should they be 
designed so that non-experts (most people) can gain 
insights about their lives? 
Limitations of the Survey and Model 
We recruited participants from a blog dedicated to personal 
informatics, a blog about general information visualization, 
and two personal informatics web sites, so most survey 
participants were familiar with personal informatics. Since 
even these interested users had plenty of problems with 
different systems, we suspect that the problems they 
encountered may be a subset of problems that common 
users may experience. We think it would be interesting to 
study users with little or no prior experience with personal 
informatics systems to find specific barriers that they may 
encounter. 
CASE STUDIES 
Having identified the stages model, the properties of the 
stages, and the barriers experienced within the stages, we 
can now apply the model to analyze personal informatics 
systems. In this section, we evaluate existing personal 
informatics systems to demonstrate the use of the model. In 
consideration of space, we only highlight some aspects of 
each system. We describe barriers that users may encounter 
and suggest potential solutions to explore further.

caffeine consumption on my sleep patterns?). 
The iterative property of personal informatics systems 
suggests that systems should be flexible to support users' 
changing information needs. Systems could be flexible by 
1) supporting importing data from other systems, as well as, 
exporting to other systems; and 2) supporting different 
kinds of information. Since tool changes may render 
previously collected data useless, systems should support 
rapid iteration, so that users can quickly hone in on the 
questions they want to answer and select the appropriate 
tools to collect the necessary information. 
User-driven vs. System-driven  
Each stage can be classified as user-driven, system-driven, 
or a combination of both. When a stage is user-driven, the 
user is responsible for the activity in the stage. In the 
Preparation stage, the user decides what type of information 
to collect and what tools to use. User-driven collection is 
when users record information on paper or enter 
information into a spreadsheet, an application, or a website 
form. User-driven integration is when users have to 
transcribe collected information, so that they can reflect on 
it. In the Reflection stage, the user reflects on the 
information without the aid of visualizations or other tools 
for exploring the data. In the Action stage, the user is 
responsible for deciding on actions to take depending on 
their conclusions from the data without aid from the system. 
User-driven stages demand time and attention from the 
user. This is problematic when the demand becomes too 
much (e.g., high frequency of collection). There are ways to 
facilitate user-driven stages. For example, systems that use 
user-driven collection can motivate the user to collect the 
information. Hsieh and colleagues [11] have explored this 
in the context of experience sampling; they encouraged

information. The survey ended with demographics 
questions (e.g., gender, age range, marital status,

The 
following are example questions from the survey1: 
• How difficult is it to collect this personal information? 
• What was your initial motivation to reflect on this 
collected personal information? 
• What patterns (repeating events) have you found when 
exploring this collected personal information?

web 
sites 
(http://slifelabs.com and http://moodjam.org). We chose 
these web sites because their readers and users were more 
likely to have used one or more personal informatics 
systems. Survey participants were entered into a raffle for a 
$25 Amazon gift certificate. We interviewed a subset of 
these participants using instant messenger to collect 
additional details about their responses. Interviewees 
received an additional $10 Amazon gift certificate.    
We had 68 people complete the surveys, and 11 agreed to 
participate in the follow-up interviews. 37 participants were 
male. Ages ranged from 18 to 64 with a median age range 
of 26 to 30. About half had graduate degrees and another 
half were in college. More than half worked full-time. 
Participants

online, and managed bills and bank accounts online.

 Cascading barriers suggest that a holistic approach to the 
design of personal informatics systems is critical. Focusing 
only on one stage ignores the whole experience of the user 
with the system. While we can take inspiration from 
different fields to resolve barriers within each stage (e.g., 
visualization techniques from information visualization 
research), creating an effective personal informatics system 
requires the consideration of all of the system's parts.  
Stages are Iterative 
Another property of personal informatics systems is that the 
stages are iterative, i.e., users incorporate new data, tools, 
and/or processes as they progress through the stages. We 
asked our interviewees whether they knew what personal 
information to collect when they first decided to collect 
information. Many said they knew, but some changed their 
minds when they found a different collection method. For 
example, P37 switched between multitudes of tools 
(whiteboard, spreadsheet, WiiFit) to collect physical 
activity information.  As mentioned before, P48 changed 
tools as she found new ones (Google spreadsheets, Daytum, 
your.flowingdata). The iterative process was not supported 
well in either case. For example, P48 did not transfer her 
spreadsheet data because Daytum did not support importing 
data (at the time she used the system). When she switched 
to your.flowingdata, she could not import her Daytum data. 
Some participants changed what personal information they 
needed while going through the stages, which resulted in 
tool changes. P23 changed collection tools because of 
changes in the types of physical activity she performed: 1) 
spreadsheet for biking and running several years ago; 2) she 
got a WiiFit last Christmas for physical activity games; 3) 
she uses DailyBurn now for her gym attendance. P44, who 
programmed his own visualizations to learn about his 
sleeping habits, continually added new information (e.g.,

2024-06-19 19:04:02,262 - root - INFO - final_answer: When processing data from user studies, researchers commonly use various statistical methods to analyze and draw meaningful conclusions. Some of the common statistical methods include descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, correlation analysis, regression analysis, and factor analysis. 

Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe the main features of the data collected from user studies. Inferential statistics help researchers make inferences and generalizations about the larger population based on the data collected from a sample. Correlation analysis is used to identify relationships between different variables in user studies.

Regression analysis is commonly employed to understand the relationships between variables and predict outcomes based on the data collected. Factor analysis helps in identifying underlying factors or latent variables that may be influencing the data from user studies.

The steps involved in processing data from user studies typically include user-driven collection, reflection, and action stages. During these stages, users decide what information to collect, reflect on the data collected, and make decisions based on their conclusions. The process is iterative, allowing users to incorporate new data, tools, and processes as they progress. The flexibility of personal informatics systems supports users' changing information needs through importing, exporting, and different types of information support.
