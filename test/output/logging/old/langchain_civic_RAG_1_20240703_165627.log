 8  CONCLUSION 
This paper  presents  an  exploratory study  in  which  we  co-
designed  and  then  evaluated  with  people  with  OAB  and 
health professionals an OAB mHealth app. We commenced 
with an  OAB and  mHealth  app literature review and  used 
this as the basis for our requirements gathering interviews. 
Based on the data collected we designed the first prototype 
and validated it again with the same stakeholder categories. 
Given  the  second  round  of  feedback,  we  improved  the 
design of the app and evaluated it in a field study for nine 
days with people with OAB.

 3.1  Medical Participants 

3.1.1 Methodology. We  started  with  MPs  interviews  as  we 
wished  to  understand  whether  they  agreed  with  the 
concepts  derived  from  the  literature  and  whether  they 
would  suggest  additional  ones.  We  interviewed  four  MPs: 
two  medical  consultants 
two  urinary 
continence specialist nurses (MP3-4). Three interviews were 
conducted  via  telephone  and  one  face-to-face  (MP2).  Each 
interview lasted one hour and was divided into three phases 
(Table 1).

 7  LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
One limitation of our work is the low number of UPs in our 
field  study.  Despite  using  all  the  usual  routes  and  OAB 
association  websites,  we  encountered  major  recruitment 
issues. As we are planning in our next studies to make the 
app  freely  available  for  download,  we  hope  to  achieve 
higher numbers. Our next step is to conduct a longer-term 
field study to evaluate if the app can increase adherence to 
self-managed treatment and raise awareness of symptoms.

5  STUDY 3 – SHORT FIELD STUDY 
Kjeldskov  and  Skov  [47]  and  Baillie  and  Schatz  [6] 
underline  the  importance  of  conducting  short  in  situ 
evaluations  as  lab-based  ones  could  leave  usability  or  UX 
issues  unrevealed. We, therefore, evaluated the  app  during 
a  short  field  study  with  UPs.  When  evaluating  an  app  for 
older  adults  with  age-related  macular  degeneration, 
Hakobyan  et  al.  [26]  conducted  a  preliminary  7  days 
evaluation  study  before  carrying  on  with  a  6  weeks 
longitudinal  field  one.  Previous  sensor  research  [34,  39] 
found  differences  between  weekdays  and  weekends  and 
recommend undertaking a study which lasts at least a week 
(best  9-11  days)  and  collects  both  weekday  and  weekend 
data. Given this, we ran the study for 9 days.
