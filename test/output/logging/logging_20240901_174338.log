We believe the model and its properties will be valuable for 
future  research  and  development  because  it  provides  a 
for  describing,  comparing,  and 
common 
evaluating 
systems.  Personal 
informatics 
informatics  systems  pose  new  interesting  HCI  challenges. 
We believe that the stage-based model, the identification of 
the  barriers  within  each  stage,  and  the  description  of  the 
properties  of  the  stages  will  help  HCI  researchers  and 
practitioners  find  solutions  and  explore  new  approaches  in 
personal informatics more efficiently.
