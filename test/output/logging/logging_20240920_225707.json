        "These  are  extreme  examples,  but  regular  people  are \ntracking one or two types of personal information and using \ncomputing  technology  in  the  form  of  personal  informatics \nsystems to do so.",
        "Personal \ninformatics \ninformatics  systems  pose  new  interesting  HCI  challenges. We believe that the stage-based model, the identification of \nthe  barriers  within  each  stage,  and  the  description  of  the \nproperties  of  the  stages  will  help  HCI  researchers  and \npractitioners  find  solutions  and  explore  new  approaches  in \npersonal informatics more efficiently.",
