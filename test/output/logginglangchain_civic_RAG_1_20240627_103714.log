 team (12 researchers conducted interviews in total). 
9 interviewees identified as male, 13 as female. They ranged 
in age from 24 to 39 (mean: 29.7, median: 29.5). Interview 
participants were compensated with a $20 Amazon gift card. 
Interview themes were identified and codes were created 
through a discussion with all interviewers. Two interviewers 
qualitatively coded each interview, with codes iteratively 
refined through discussion.

Limitations 
We focused on three common, yet diverse, domains in which 
people self-track. People self-track in many other domains, 
including to manage chronic illnesses, in which people might 
have different motivations or tracking habits. Although we 
believe our findings are extensible to domains other than the 
three on which we report (e.g., biometric or food tracking), 
they do not necessarily cover all motivations and usages. 
Some people track the domains we study using different 
classes of tools that we do not extensively report on, such as 
tools that passively record location (e.g., Moves, SenseCam 
[17]). Although we believe this suggests these are used 
relatively infrequently compared to those we report on 
(or possible limitations in our recruitment techniques), our 
findings on tracking in a particular domain may not 
generalize to all tools or people tracking that type of data. 
We believe our recruitment overrepresents people who 
currently identify as self-trackers, as our recruitment 
materials were likely to draw people who were currently 
interested in self-tracking (e.g., posting the task on AMT as 
a “Survey on Location, Physical Activity, and Finance 
Tracking”). This is one weakness of our research, and future 
work should further explore people’s reasons for deciding 
not to return to tracking.
