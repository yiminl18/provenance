            "Two researchers ﬁrst read the responses with the research ques-\ntions in mind, blinded to conditions, and came up with four\nquantitative cross-group comparisons. One researcher then\ncoded the responses manually, blinded to conditions. First,\nwe looked at how many participants in each group showed\nconfusion about the story, by saying \"I was confused\", \"not\nclear what is happening\". Second, we compared the average\nlength of response in two groups. Third, we counted how many\nemotion-descriptive (e.g. \"emotional\", \"nostalgic\") words they\nused to describe themselves. Fourth, we compared if they re-\ncalled a past experience from the animation. The comparison\nresults are listed in Table 2. The results speak positively about\nthe engaging effect of personalized animations (less confusing,\nmore emotionally engaging, inducing lengthier writings and\nmore recalling of past experiences), but are not statistically\nsigniﬁcant.",
