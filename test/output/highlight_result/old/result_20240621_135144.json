    "final_answer": "In processing data from user studies, several statistical methods are commonly utilized to ensure accuracy and reliability of the findings. These methods include quantitative reflective designs, thematic analysis in psychology, leveraging bodily signals and false feedback to regulate emotions, descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, and correlation analysis. Through the application of these statistical methods, researchers aim to create engaging narratives based on personal contextual differences in behavior and mental well-being, interpret personalized animations for self-reflection and behavior change, and maximize self-compassion and motivation for users through emotional narratives and animations. The combination of these statistical approaches allows for a comprehensive analysis and interpretation of data collected from user studies.",

                "asked, \"what do you think the video reflected about you\".\r\nWhile physiological, behavioral and self-report data can be\r\nused to track user’s psychological processes [19], in this work,\r\nwe use self-reported mood and behavior data for three reasons:\r\nFirst, we can avoid challenges in the interpretation of physiol\u0002ogy data, such as the difficulty in distinguishing between joy\r\nand anger [3]; Second, users can recall and implicitly select\r\nthe affective states they wish to have feedback on, which pro\u0002motes mindfulness and awareness of their emotions [1]; Third,\r\nusers are required to recall the past 24 hours every day, so their\r\nmemory of the events should be relatively reliable [12].\r\nThe goal of this project is to open up the design space where\r\nusers’ mood and behavior data are relived in an emotional\r\nnarrative, in order to maximize viewer’s self-compassion and\r\nmotivation to maintain or change their behavior post viewing.\r\nWe demonstrate in a one-week randomized control study that\r\nwhile both animation don’t involve a traditional \"story\" narra\u0002tive, users are better at interpreting personalized animations\r\ncompared to a generic animation; that users are able to connect\r\nto the animated agent, engage with the animated movies emo\u0002tionally and constructively reflect on their mood and behavior\r\npatterns.\r\nFigure 1. A common story structure for animated feature films. The\r\nrat, robot and clown fish characters are from Ratatouille (Pixar, 2007),\r\nWall-E (Pixar, 2008) and Finding Nemo (Pixar, 2003).\r\nRELATED WORK\r\nThis section summarizes previous research on designing HCI\r\nsystems to reflect affective states and building motivational\r\nnarratives for self-reflection and behavior change.\r\nReflective Design\r\nReflective design focuses on embedding unconscious cultural\r\nassumptions and values in the design of IT systems, in particu\u0002lar to promote a user’s critical understanding of such values",

Random assignment was made resulting\r\nin 13 of them assigned to the control group, and 14 to the per\u0002sonalized group. One participant in the control group dropped\r\nout of the study and asked to have his/her data deleted. All\r\nparticipants took pre-study surveys including tests on person\u0002ality, stress level and mental health status. Each day during the\r\nweek, participants reported their daily mood and behavioral\r\ndata through an online Google Forms survey.\r\nAt the end of the week, participants received an animated\r\nmovie through email, and were instructed to watch it. Mem\u0002bers of the personalized group each received a story that was\r\npersonalized according to each individual’s mood and behav\u0002ioral data, while the control group receive a non-personalized\r\nanimated video of the same length, featuring a corgi dog ren\u0002dered from the same models. Considering that the one-line\r\ncues are part of the personalization package, they were only\r\nused in the personalized group. The control video is generated\r\nfrom real data of a preliminary study participant, showing the\r\ncorgi dog running through a forest, facing a stressful rain of\r\nrocks, having one negative and one positive interaction with\r\nanother dog and in the end running uphill on a good note.\r\nThe control video was picked such that it features some ups\r\nand downs that all participants might relate to their surveyed\r\nexperience.\r\nAll participants were told the same story: that the video was\r\ncustomized to their mood and behavior data. After watching\r\nthe videos, participants filled out an evaluation form. There\r\nwere three questions that accepted free text-form responses,\r\nwithout prompting the participants with any of the researcher’s\r\npreconceptions such as \"stress\" or \"social interaction\":",
