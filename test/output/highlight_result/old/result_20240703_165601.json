            "\n\nRESULTS – THEMES AND PATTERNS\nIn  total,  our  corpus  included  76  papers,  all  published\nbetween 2000 and 2013. The average publication year was\n2010 and the median 2011. A plurality of papers come from\nthe  ACM  SIGCHI  conference,  either  the  full  proceedings\n(13 papers) or the extended abstracts (16). The later include\na mix of workshop descriptions, works in progress, posters,\netc. The next largest contingent appears in the Creativity &\nCognition  conference  (8).  The  remainder  occurred  in  such\nvenues  as  Designing  Interactive  Systems  (3),  Artificial\nIntelligence  and  Education  (3),  iConference  (2),  Tangible\nand  Embedded  Computing  (2),  and  other  similar  venues.\nThe  papers  themselves  describe  a  variety  of  endeavors,\nincluding  interactive  systems  to  support  reflection  [e.g.,\n12], methods intended to incorporate reflection into design\nprocesses  [e.g., 19],  techniques  for  user  studies  [e.g.,\n39,40],  empirical  studies  of  reflective  practitioners  [e.g.,\n73,68], and others.",

These\nthemes became the  basis for  a  series  of  memos,  with each\nmemo both describing one theme or pattern and indicating\nthe reason for its interest or significance. The memos were\nthen  circulated  among  the  authors,  who  discussed  them\nfurther,  refined  them,  and  considered  relationships  among\nthem. These memos, and the themes they describe, form the\nbasis for the following sections.",

Of  those,  we\nsought  papers  that  involved  studies  of  some  person  or\npersons  (often  users  though  not  always)  who  were\nreflecting.  We  excluded  papers  where  the  keyword\n“reflection”  was  used  to  refer  to  the  optical  phenomenon,\ne.g.,  “frustrated  total  internal  reflection”  as  a  technique  in\ntouch-based  interfaces. We  also  excluded  papers  that  were\nreflections on the field of HCI where the  authors were the\nprimary people doing the reflecting. This process resulted in\n76 papers being included in our review.\n\nReading and Analysis\nWe began our analysis by developing a series of questions\nintended  to  provide  a  sense  for  how  reflection  was\nconceptualized and deployed.\n\n1. What definition of reflection does the paper offer?\n2. To what application domain does the paper pertain?\n3. Who  are  the  people  doing  the  reflecting  (e.g.,  system",
