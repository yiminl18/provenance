    "final_answer": "In processing data from user studies, common statistical methods used include quantitative analysis such as iterating through the data, summarizing them in statistics, tables, or graphs, as well as deploying a more qualitative approach by embedding meanings in dynamic visuals, audio, and physical forms to provide ambiguous feedback to the user. Storytelling or narratives are also essential in helping users interpret self-tracking data and constructing appropriate narratives for reflective purposes.\n\nSpecifically, three statistical methods typically employed in processing data from user studies are physiological, behavioral, and self-report data. In a particular study mentioned, self-reported mood and behavior data were utilized due to challenges in interpreting physiological data and to promote mindfulness. The aim was to create a design space where users' mood and behavior data are experienced in an emotional narrative.",

Additionally, some designers deploy a more qualitative approach, embedding meanings in dynamic visuals, audio, and physical forms to provide less precise but more ambiguous feedback to the user. Storytelling or narratives are fundamental in helping users interpret self-tracking data and constructing appropriate narratives for different reflective purposes.",

                "While physiological, behavioral and self-report data can be\nused to track user’s psychological processes [19], in this work,\nwe use self-reported mood and behavior data for three reasons:\nFirst, we can avoid challenges in the interpretation of physiol-\nogy data, such as the difﬁculty in distinguishing between joy\nand anger [3]; Second, users can recall and implicitly select\nthe affective states they wish to have feedback on, which pro-\nmotes mindfulness and awareness of their emotions [1]; Third,\nusers are required to recall the past 24 hours every day, so their\nmemory of the events should be relatively reliable [12].\nThe goal of this project is to open up the design space where\nusers’ mood and behavior data are relived in an emotional\nnarrative, in order to maximize viewer’s self-compassion and\nmotivation to maintain or change their behavior post viewing.\nWe demonstrate in a one-week randomized control study that\nwhile both animation don’t involve a traditional \"story\" narra-\ntive, users are better at interpreting personalized animations\ncompared to a generic animation; that users are able to connect\nto the animated agent, engage with the animated movies emo-\ntionally and constructively reﬂect on their mood and behavior\npatterns.\nFigure 1.
