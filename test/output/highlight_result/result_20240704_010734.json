            "3.2  User Participants \n\n3.2.1 Methodology.  During  our  MPs  interviews,  we  asked \nabout how we should approach our co-design with UPs. We \nwere advised to use single or same gender paired interviews \nand  not  to  use  any  group-based  techniques  (e.g.,  focus \ngroup, design  workshops). We interviewed nine UPs  -  two \nmales and seven females (UP1-9) since the OAB prevalence \nis  higher  in  women  [17].  UPs’  age  range  was  23-80,  mean \nage  51.  Their  symptoms  varied  from  mild  (voiding \njust  outside  the  normal  parameters,  mild \nfrequency \nurgency,  and  no  leakages)  to  severe  (increased  number  of \nvoids,  high  urgency,  and  leakages).  Most  UPs  (8/9)  were \nconfident in using a smartphone. Each interview lasted two \nhours and was divided into three parts (Table 2). UPs were \nrecruited via newsletter and research contacts. \n\nTable 2. User Participants – Interview Structure. \n\nPhase \n\nContent \n\nPhase 1 Experiences  Open-ended questions.",
