            "\n\nRESULTS – THEMES AND PATTERNS\nIn  total,  our  corpus  included  76  papers,  all  published\nbetween 2000 and 2013. The average publication year was\n2010 and the median 2011. A plurality of papers come from\nthe  ACM  SIGCHI  conference,  either  the  full  proceedings\n(13 papers) or the extended abstracts (16). The later include\na mix of workshop descriptions, works in progress, posters,\netc. The next largest contingent appears in the Creativity &\nCognition  conference  (8).  The  remainder  occurred  in  such\nvenues  as  Designing  Interactive  Systems  (3),  Artificial\nIntelligence  and  Education  (3),  iConference  (2),  Tangible\nand  Embedded  Computing  (2),  and  other  similar  venues.\nThe  papers  themselves  describe  a  variety  of  endeavors,\nincluding  interactive  systems  to  support  reflection  [e.g.,\n12], methods intended to incorporate reflection into design\nprocesses  [e.g., 19],  techniques  for  user  studies  [e.g.,\n39,40],  empirical  studies  of  reflective  practitioners  [e.g.,\n73,68], and others.",

            "CONCLUSION\nWhile  the  literature  on  reflection  and  reflective  thought  is\ndecades  old  [e.g., 20], reflection has only recently come to\nfocus  in  HCI.  While  the  oldest  paper  in  our  corpus  was\npublished in 2000, most papers in the review presented here\nwere  published  in  the  years  since  2009.  We  suggest  this\nrecency  as  evidence  of  increasing  interest  in  designing  for\nreflection. Indeed, an increased interest in reflection aligns\nclosely  with  many  concerns  concomitant  with  third  wave\nHCI [11,35]. As research progresses in this area, we believe\nthat  the  directions  described  in  our  discussion  section  will\nbe  helpful  in  shaping  research  trajectory.  Specifically,  we\nreiterate three main implications here.",

            "ReflectionDIS 2014, June 21–25, 2014, Vancouver, BC, Canada93\fwhat constituted reflection. The goal was not to articulate a\nhighly specific definition, but rather to provide some set of\ncriteria  for  whether  a  paper  should  or  should  not  be\nincluded in our review. Drawing on ideas from Dewey [20],\nSchön  [76],  Moon  [67],  and  others,  we  see  reflection  as\nreviewing  a  series of  previous  experiences, events, stories,\netc., and putting them together in such a way as to come to\na better understanding or to gain some sort of insight. This\nbroad,  general  conceptualization  was  intentional,  as  this\nreview is meant to be inclusive rather than exclusive. These\nbasic ideas were used to guide our literature search.",
