            "Models of Personal Informatics \nLi et al. develop a stage-based model of personal informatics \nsystems  and  describe  barriers  people  face  in  each  stage \n(Figure 1) [21]. The model has five stages: 1) preparation, or \nstarting to collect data and thinking about what information \nto  record  and  how  to  collect  it;  2)  collection,  or  gathering \ndata;  3)  integration,  or  preparing  data  to  reflect  upon; \n4) reflection, or examining and exploring data; and 5) action, \nor  taking  one’s  newfound  understanding  of  themselves  to \ninform changes. Motivated by the Transtheoretical Model of \nBehavior  Change  (TTM)  [32],  Li  et  al.  later  identify  two \nphases  of  reflection,  discovery  and  maintenance,  and  note \npeople ask different types of questions in each phase [22].",

            "\n\nABSTRACT \nCurrent  models  of  how  people  use  personal  informatics \nsystems are largely based in behavior change goals. They do \nnot  adequately  characterize  the  integration  of  self-tracking \ninto  everyday  life  by  people  with  varying  goals.  We  build \nupon  prior  work  by  embracing  the  perspective  of  lived \ninformatics to propose a new model of personal informatics. \nWe examine how lived informatics manifests in the habits of \nself-trackers across a variety of domains, first by surveying \n105, 99, and 83 past and present trackers of physical activity, \nfinances, and location and then by interviewing 22 trackers \nregarding their lived informatics experiences. We develop a \nmodel characterizing tracker processes of deciding to track \nand selecting a tool, elaborate on tool usage during collection, \nintegration,  and  reflection  as  components  of  tracking  and \nacting,  and  discuss  the  lapsing  and  potential  resuming  of \ntracking.  We  use  our  model  to  surface  underexplored \nchallenges  in  lived  informatics,  thus  identifying  future \ndirections for personal informatics design and research.  ",
