This property of personal informatics systems opens several 
opportunities for research and applications. Many existing 
technologies are capable of collecting various types of 
personal information, and researchers in ubiquitous 
computing and lifelogging are developing new collection 
tools. How can personal informatics systems leverage these 
new technologies to inform people about different facets of 
their lives? What would visualizations that show multiple 
facets of people's lives look like? How should they be 
designed so that non-experts (most people) can gain 
insights about their lives? 
Limitations of the Survey and Model 
We recruited participants from a blog dedicated to personal 
informatics, a blog about general information visualization, 
and two personal informatics web sites, so most survey 
participants were familiar with personal informatics. Since 
even these interested users had plenty of problems with 
different systems, we suspect that the problems they 
encountered may be a subset of problems that common 
users may experience. We think it would be interesting to 
study users with little or no prior experience with personal 
informatics systems to find specific barriers that they may 
encounter. 
CASE STUDIES 
Having identified the stages model, the properties of the 
stages, and the barriers experienced within the stages, we 
can now apply the model to analyze personal informatics 
systems. In this section, we evaluate existing personal 
informatics systems to demonstrate the use of the model. In 
consideration of space, we only highlight some aspects of 
each system. We describe barriers that users may encounter 
and suggest potential solutions to explore further.

 communicate. 60% of them used social networking sites 
daily. Most read news websites and blogs, ordered products 
online, and managed bills and bank accounts online. 
RESULTS 
We created affinity diagrams to analyze the survey and 
interviews. We did not determine a coding scheme 
beforehand; instead we identified themes from the data as 
we processed the responses. During the analysis, we 
identified the types of personal information collected and 
reflected on by participants, motivations for collection and 
reflection, and problems experienced. Next, we analyzed 
the survey and interviews for experiences with tools and 
barriers that users encountered, identifying a model of 
personal informatics. 
Collected Personal Information 
Participants reported a wide variety of information that they 
collected and reflected on (see Table 1). Many participants 
reflected on automatically collected information such as 
bank statements and email history, since they are readily 
available. Automatically collected information was split

caffeine consumption on my sleep patterns?). 
The iterative property of personal informatics systems 
suggests that systems should be flexible to support users' 
changing information needs. Systems could be flexible by 
1) supporting importing data from other systems, as well as, 
exporting to other systems; and 2) supporting different 
kinds of information. Since tool changes may render 
previously collected data useless, systems should support 
rapid iteration, so that users can quickly hone in on the 
questions they want to answer and select the appropriate 
tools to collect the necessary information. 
User-driven vs. System-driven  
Each stage can be classified as user-driven, system-driven, 
or a combination of both. When a stage is user-driven, the 
user is responsible for the activity in the stage. In the 
Preparation stage, the user decides what type of information 
to collect and what tools to use. User-driven collection is 
when users record information on paper or enter 
information into a spreadsheet, an application, or a website 
form. User-driven integration is when users have to 
transcribe collected information, so that they can reflect on 
it. In the Reflection stage, the user reflects on the 
information without the aid of visualizations or other tools 
for exploring the data. In the Action stage, the user is 
responsible for deciding on actions to take depending on 
their conclusions from the data without aid from the system. 
User-driven stages demand time and attention from the 
user. This is problematic when the demand becomes too 
much (e.g., high frequency of collection). There are ways to 
facilitate user-driven stages. For example, systems that use 
user-driven collection can motivate the user to collect the 
information. Hsieh and colleagues [11] have explored this 
in the context of experience sampling; they encouraged

 used pen and paper because of their flexibility and ease of 
use; people can take them anywhere and they are easily 
accessible when a note needs to be written. This group 
faced a problem in having to transcribe their data to an 
electronic format in order to visualize their data. Some used 
Excel spreadsheets for graphing. Many used existing 
personal informatics web sites for collecting and reflecting 
on various information, such as finance, food consumption, 
mood, and physical activity. Some used physical devices 
such as pedometers, the WiiFit, and a continuous positive 
airway pressure (CPAP) machine for tracking sleep apnea. 
Some activities had an infrastructure that automatically 
records information such as financial transactions, search 
history, and communication tools (e.g., email, instant 
messenger, and IRC), which people later explored for 
personal 
information. 
Some 
with 
programming 
backgrounds devised their own way of exploring data (e.g., 
statistical packages for analysis, and programming 
languages to organize and cull information). 
Reasons 
Participants gave several reasons for collecting and 
reflecting on personal information: natural curiosity, 
interest in data, discovery of new tools, suggestion from 
another person, and trigger events. 
Some people cited curiosity about themselves prompted 
them to collect personal information. P22 said, ‚ÄúCuriosity: 
Q: how much would I walk if I didn‚Äôt ride my bike? A: kind 
of a lot, but not as much as you‚Äôd think.‚Äù Some people 
identified themselves by their interest in quantitative data. 
Some participants used the terms ‚Äúdata nerd‚Äù, ‚Äúa student of 
information visualization‚Äù, and ‚Äúgeekiness‚Äù to describe 
themselves. There is also the added value that the data is 
about them. P40 said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an engineer, so numbers and 
trends and stuff just interest me in general. Plus this data is 
about ME (her emphasis).‚Äù

 Cascading barriers suggest that a holistic approach to the 
design of personal informatics systems is critical. Focusing 
only on one stage ignores the whole experience of the user 
with the system. While we can take inspiration from 
different fields to resolve barriers within each stage (e.g., 
visualization techniques from information visualization 
research), creating an effective personal informatics system 
requires the consideration of all of the system's parts.  
Stages are Iterative 
Another property of personal informatics systems is that the 
stages are iterative, i.e., users incorporate new data, tools, 
and/or processes as they progress through the stages. We 
asked our interviewees whether they knew what personal 
information to collect when they first decided to collect 
information. Many said they knew, but some changed their 
minds when they found a different collection method. For 
example, P37 switched between multitudes of tools 
(whiteboard, spreadsheet, WiiFit) to collect physical 
activity information.  As mentioned before, P48 changed 
tools as she found new ones (Google spreadsheets, Daytum, 
your.flowingdata). The iterative process was not supported 
well in either case. For example, P48 did not transfer her 
spreadsheet data because Daytum did not support importing 
data (at the time she used the system). When she switched 
to your.flowingdata, she could not import her Daytum data. 
Some participants changed what personal information they 
needed while going through the stages, which resulted in 
tool changes. P23 changed collection tools because of 
changes in the types of physical activity she performed: 1) 
spreadsheet for biking and running several years ago; 2) she 
got a WiiFit last Christmas for physical activity games; 3) 
she uses DailyBurn now for her gym attendance. P44, who 
programmed his own visualizations to learn about his 
sleeping habits, continually added new information (e.g.,

Statistical methods are crucial in user studies data processing as they enable researchers to uncover trends, correlations, and insights from personal informatics data. By leveraging statistical techniques, researchers can inform individuals about different aspects of their lives and design visualizations that present multiple facets of people's lives in a comprehensible manner for non-experts to easily understand and gain insights.
