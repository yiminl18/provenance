        "question": "What is the number of disaster projects starting later than 2021?",
        "final_answer": "To determine the number of disaster projects starting later than 2021, we need to consider the information provided in the sub-answers. The first sub-answer mentions that there are no current disaster projects under construction and provides details of two completed disaster projects: the Citywide Guardrail Replacement and the Malibu Park Storm Drain Repairs. The second sub-answer states that the starting date for disaster projects after 2021 is not specified in the provided context. Therefore, based on the information available, we can conclude that there are no disaster projects starting later than 2021 as no specific starting dates for such projects are mentioned."
