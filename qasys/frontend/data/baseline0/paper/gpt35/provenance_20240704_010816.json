            "\n\nRESULTS – THEMES AND PATTERNS\nIn  total,  our  corpus  included  76  papers,  all  published\nbetween 2000 and 2013. The average publication year was\n2010 and the median 2011. A plurality of papers come from\nthe  ACM  SIGCHI  conference,  either  the  full  proceedings\n(13 papers) or the extended abstracts (16). The later include\na mix of workshop descriptions, works in progress, posters,\netc. The next largest contingent appears in the Creativity &\nCognition  conference  (8).  The  remainder  occurred  in  such\nvenues  as  Designing  Interactive  Systems  (3),  Artificial\nIntelligence  and  Education  (3),  iConference  (2),  Tangible\nand  Embedded  Computing  (2),  and  other  similar  venues.\nThe  papers  themselves  describe  a  variety  of  endeavors,\nincluding  interactive  systems  to  support  reflection  [e.g.,\n12], methods intended to incorporate reflection into design\nprocesses  [e.g., 19],  techniques  for  user  studies  [e.g.,\n39,40],  empirical  studies  of  reflective  practitioners  [e.g.,\n73,68], and others.",
