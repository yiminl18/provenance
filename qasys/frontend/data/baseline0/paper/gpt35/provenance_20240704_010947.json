            "recommendations \n\nIn  studying  how  people  use  personal  informatics  systems, \nwe  gained  an  understanding  of  their  motivations  and \npractices.  We  used  this  to  define  a  model  that  describes \npersonal  informatics  systems  as  a  series  of  5  stages.  We \ncompiled  a  comprehensive  list  of  barriers  that  people \nencountered in each stage. We also described properties of \nthe  stages:  cascading  effect  of  barriers,  iterative,  system-\ndriven  vs.  user-driven,  and  uni-faceted  vs.  multi-faceted. \nThese properties have implications in the design of personal \ninformatics \nshould  be  designed \nholistically;  2)  they  should  improve  support  for  iteration \nbetween  stages;  3)  an  appropriate  balance  of  automated \ntechnology  and  user  control  should  be  applied  within  each \nstage  to  facilitate  the  user  experience;  and  4)  they  should \nexplore  support  for  multiple  facets  of  people’s  lives  to \nenrich the value of systems.",

More  people  are \nbuilding  such  systems  and  there  is  an  opportunity  to \nprovide  design \nfor  creating  more \neffective systems. \n\nrecommendations",
            "Designers  wanting  to  support  personal  tracking  in  social \ncontexts  should  consider  features  that  help  users  pursue \nsocial benefits. For example, systems can help users access \ncommunities \nfor  specific  health  goals  and  diverse \nexploration  as  well  as  providing  strategies  to  navigate \nthrough  different  communities.  Also,  systems  can  support \nusers in integrating information from different apps that are \nbetter fit to various aspects of their health goals. \n\nFor personal informatics researchers, the personal informatics \nmodels  should  be  further  developed  to  account  for  social \ninfluence.  Researchers  should  reflect  on  how  social  needs \naffect  people’s  decisions  about  and  behavior  surrounding \nthe  acts  of  selecting  tools,  collecting,  integrating,  and \nreflecting on data, and lapsing and resuming."
