                "5 STUDY 3 – SHORT FIELD STUDY\r\nKjeldskov and Skov [47] and Baillie and Schatz [6] \r\nunderline the importance of conducting short in situ \r\nevaluations as lab-based ones could leave usability or UX \r\nissues unrevealed. We, therefore, evaluated the app during \r\na short field study with UPs. When evaluating an app for \r\nolder adults with age-related macular degeneration,\r\nHakobyan et al. [26] conducted a preliminary 7 days \r\nevaluation study before carrying on with a 6 weeks \r\nlongitudinal field one. Previous sensor research [34, 39] \r\nfound differences between weekdays and weekends and \r\nrecommend undertaking a study which lasts at least a week \r\n(best 9-11 days) and collects both weekday and weekend \r\ndata. Given this, we ran the study for 9 days.\r\n5.1 Methodology\r\nThe study was divided into three phases (Table 3) and \r\naimed to discover app usability issues, collect sensor data to \r\nunderstand how people interact with the app in the field, \r\nand understand if users’ design decisions from previous \r\nstudies hold when using the app in a real-life context.\r\nTable 3. User Participants – Study 3 Structure.\r\nPhase Content\r\nPhase 1 Set Up App installation and usability \r\nevaluation.\r\nPhase 2 Field \r\nStudy\r\nNine days uncontrolled field study.\r\nPhase 3 \r\nUninstallation\r\nApp uninstallation and usability \r\nevaluation.\r\nWe started by posting invitations on social media and flyers \r\naround universities, libraries and leisure centers. We also \r\nemailed prostate cancer support groups. As people were not \r\ncoming forward, we also advertised the study over the \r\nradio. We recruited six UPs (UP15-20), three males and \r\nthree females, age range 26 – 66, mean age 54.6. Most UPs \r\n(5/6) agreed or strongly agreed they were confident using a \r\nsmartphone. No UP was aware of other OAB apps.\r\nThe first phase was a face to face or Skype interview in \r\nwhich the app was installed on UPs’ phone. After \r\ninstallation, UPs were asked to interact with the app by",
