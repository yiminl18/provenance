The use of self-reported mood and behavior data is crucial to circumvent challenges in interpreting physiology data, encourage mindfulness, and ensure dependable memory recall of previous events. The ultimate objective is to develop personalized animations that boost self-compassion, motivation, and emotional connection for users as they reflect on their mood and behavior patterns.",

                "While physiological, behavioral and self-report data can be\nused to track user’s psychological processes [19], in this work,\nwe use self-reported mood and behavior data for three reasons:\nFirst, we can avoid challenges in the interpretation of physiol-\nogy data, such as the difﬁculty in distinguishing between joy\nand anger [3]; Second, users can recall and implicitly select\nthe affective states they wish to have feedback on, which pro-\nmotes mindfulness and awareness of their emotions [1]; Third,\nusers are required to recall the past 24 hours every day, so their\nmemory of the events should be relatively reliable [12].\nThe goal of this project is to open up the design space where\nusers’ mood and behavior data are relived in an emotional\nnarrative, in order to maximize viewer’s self-compassion and\nmotivation to maintain or change their behavior post viewing.\nWe demonstrate in a one-week randomized control study that\nwhile both animation don’t involve a traditional \"story\" narra-\ntive, users are better at interpreting personalized animations\ncompared to a generic animation; that users are able to connect\nto the animated agent, engage with the animated movies emo-\ntionally and constructively reﬂect on their mood and behavior\npatterns.\nFigure 1. A common story structure for animated feature ﬁlms. The\nrat, robot and clown ﬁsh characters are from Ratatouille (Pixar, 2007),\nWall-E (Pixar, 2008) and Finding Nemo (Pixar, 2003).\nRELATED WORK\nThis section summarizes previous research on designing HCI\nsystems to reﬂect affective states and building motivational\nnarratives for self-reﬂection and behavior change.\nReﬂective Design\nReﬂective design focuses on embedding unconscious cultural\nassumptions and values in the design of IT systems, in particu-\nlar to promote a user’s critical understanding of such values\n[26]. Höök proposed the concept of the affective loop expe-\nrience where the users are pulled into either virtual or bodily\nfeedback loops to their own emotions [10].",

                "protocol and recruitment process are pre-approved by the MIT\nCommittee On the Use of Humans as Experimental Subjects\n(COUHES).\nWe sent emails to university labs and dorms, recruiting 27 par-\nticipants aged 18-36. Random assignment was made resulting\nin 13 of them assigned to the control group, and 14 to the per-\nsonalized group. One participant in the control group dropped\nout of the study and asked to have his/her data deleted. All\nparticipants took pre-study surveys including tests on person-\nality, stress level and mental health status. Each day during the\nweek, participants reported their daily mood and behavioral\ndata through an online Google Forms survey.\nAt the end of the week, participants received an animated\nmovie through email, and were instructed to watch it. Mem-\nbers of the personalized group each received a story that was\npersonalized according to each individual’s mood and behav-\nioral data, while the control group receive a non-personalized\nanimated video of the same length, featuring a corgi dog ren-\ndered from the same models. Considering that the one-line\ncues are part of the personalization package, they were only\nused in the personalized group. The control video is generated\nfrom real data of a preliminary study participant, showing the\ncorgi dog running through a forest, facing a stressful rain of\nrocks, having one negative and one positive interaction with\nanother dog and in the end running uphill on a good note.\nThe control video was picked such that it features some ups\nand downs that all participants might relate to their surveyed\nexperience.\nAll participants were told the same story: that the video was\ncustomized to their mood and behavior data. After watching\nthe videos, participants ﬁlled out an evaluation form. There\nwere three questions that accepted free text-form responses,\nwithout prompting the participants with any of the researcher’s\npreconceptions such as \"stress\" or \"social interaction\":",
