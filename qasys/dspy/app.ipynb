In 2023, it was the fourteenth-busiest airport in the United States and the 30th-busiest in the world by passenger count. It is the fifth-largest hub for United Airlines, functioning as the airline's primary transpacific gateway, and as a major maintenance hub. It also serves as a hub for Alaska Airlines. \n",
      "\n",
      "3] During World War II, the airport was used as a Coast Guard base and Army Air Corps training and staging base. The base was called Naval Auxiliary Air Facility Mills Field and Coast Guard Air Station, San Francisco.  Pan American World Airways (Pan Am), which had operated international flying boat service from Treasure Island, had to move its Pacific and Alaska seaplane operations to SFO in 1944 after Treasure Island was expropriated for use as a military base. Pan Am began service from SFO after World War \n",
      "\n",
      "4] The airport is owned and operated by the City and County of San Francisco and has a mailing address with a ZIP code assigned to San Francisco. Between 1999 and 2004, the San Francisco Airport Commission operated city-owned SFO Enterprises Inc to oversee its business purchases and operations of ventures. \n",

San Francisco held a dedication ceremony at the airfield, officially named the Mills Field Municipal Airport of San Francisco, on May 7, 1927, on the 150-acre cow pasture. The land was leased from the Mills Estate in an agreement made with Ogden L. Mills who oversaw the large tracts of property originally acquired by his \n",

The airport's name was officially changed to San Francisco Airport in 1931 upon the purchase of the land. \"International\" was added at the end of World War II as overseas service rapidly expanded. \n",
      "\n",
      "9] The Marina District of San Francisco, hard hit by the 1989 earthquake, was built on fill that had been placed there for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition, although liquefaction did not occur on a large scale. In the 1990s, San Francisco International Airport proposed filling in hundreds more acres to extend its overcrowded international runways in exchange for purchasing other parts of the bay and converting them back to wetlands. The idea was, and remains, controversial. (For further details, \n",
