ABSTRACT
Mobile health applications that track activities, such as exercise,
sleep, and diet, are becoming widely used. While these activity
tracking applications have the potential to improve our health,
user engagement and retention are critical factors for their success.
However, long-term user engagement patterns in real-world activity
tracking applications are not yet well understood.

Here we study user engagement patterns within a mobile physi-
cal activity tracking application consisting of 115 million logged
activities taken by over a million users over 31 months. Specifically,
we show that over 75% of users return and re-engage with the appli-
cation after prolonged periods of inactivity, no matter the duration
of the inactivity.

We find a surprising result that the re-engagement usage pat-
terns resemble those of the start of the initial engagement period,
rather than being a simple continuation of the end of the initial
engagement period. This evidence points to a conceptual model of
multiple lives of user engagement, extending the prevalent single
life view of user activity. We demonstrate that these multiple lives
occur because the users have a variety of different primary intents
or goals for using the app. These primary intents are associated
with how long each life lasts and how likely the user is to re-engage
for a new life. We find evidence for users being more likely to stop
using the app once they achieved their primary intent or goal (e.g.,
weight loss). However, these users might return once their original
intent resurfaces (e.g., wanting to lose newly gained weight). We
discuss implications of the multiple life paradigm and propose a
novel prediction task of predicting the number of lives of a user.
Based on insights developed in this work, including a marker of im-
proved primary intent performance, our prediction models achieve
71% ROC AUC. Overall, our research has implications for modeling
user re-engagement in health activity tracking applications and has
consequences for how notifications, recommendations as well as
gamification can be used to increase engagement.

2013 found that 69% of US adults keep track of one or more health
indicators including weight, diet, exercise, or symptoms, and 21%
among them used a mobile app or device to do so [17]. Globally,
the mobile health market is projected market to grow to over $500
billion by 2025 [44]. Understanding how users engage with mobile
activity tracking applications has the potential to signficantly im-
prove people’s health, for instance by preventing negative health
outcomes and promoting the adoption and maintenance of healthy
behaviors [4, 30, 43].

However, user engagement patterns in these activity tracking
applications, especially long-term and at scale, are not yet well
understood. While there has been a wealth of research on user
engagement in various online settings (e.g., [12, 24, 31, 32, 36, 37]),
it is unclear how users engage and re-engage with activity track-
ing applications that capture their offline lives in the real world.
Understanding user engagement in these real-world contexts is
particularly important given that we could help people improve
their health. As mobile health applications that track a variety of
health metrics and daily activities are becoming more popular, it
is important to model and understand user engagement in these
applications.

Typical modeling of user engagement considers users to have a
single “lifetime” (or “lifespan”) during which the user typically be-
comes less and less engaged on the platform [11, 13, 15, 22, 45, 48].
This conceptual model of a single lifetime has been widely used
in user modeling and engagement research, as well as interven-
tions aimed at increasing user engagement [5, 9–11, 13, 22, 45].
For example, existing work has focused on predicting the duration
of user’s single lifetime [15, 21, 23, 46] and attempted to extend a
user’s lifetime to retain them [6, 48]. Usually, once a user has been
absent for a long time, they are very unlikely to return and thus
pronounced “dead” [25]. Survival modeling techniques, which have
been applied to user modeling [16, 21, 23], also assume that once a
user has “died”, they are not coming back to re-engage with the app.
However, in the context of activity tracking applications that track
real-world behaviors, user engagement patterns may not follow
this single lifetime model. Users may return to re-engage with ap-
plications after long periods of inactivity and, this way, start a new
life. There is a limited understanding of how users re-engage with
activity tracking apps after long periods of inactivity, the mech-
anisms behind such behavior, and whether this behavior may be
predictable ahead of time.
This work. Here, we conduct a large-scale observational study
of user re-engagement patterns within a mobile activity tracking
application. We demonstrate empirically, across 115 million logged
activities taken by over a million users over 31 months, that over
75% of active users do return to the application after a prolonged
period of inactivity. This behavior is independent of the duration of
inactivity and often users return to the application multiple times.
While many applications use notifications and e-mails to regain

Track: Web of Things, Mobile and Ubiquitous ComputingWWW 2018, April 23-27, 2018, Lyon, France1501user attention after brief periods of inactivity (e.g., a few days),
we observe a large fraction of users returning after much longer
periods of time (e.g., 90 days). Importantly, the usage patterns when
re-engaging with the app mimic those of the start of the user’s
initial engagement period and cannot be explained as a simple
continuation of the end of the initial engagement period. These
observations suggest a conceptual model of user engagement ex-
hibiting multiple lives, where user activity after re-engagement is
more similar to the beginning of the previous life than the end of it.
Users re-engage with this application after prolonged inactivity to
begin a new life, rather than continuing patterns of their previous
life—often again and again. This multiple life paradigm stands in
contrast to the single life paradigm prevalent in existing work on
user lifetime modeling.

Despite a variety of available activities in the app, we find that
users generally focus on logging a single primary activity, reflecting
the user’s goal or primary intent. We show that multiple lives occur
because users have a variety of different primary intents for using
the mobile health app. While primary intents are different from user
to user, the intents stay relatively constant over multiple lives of the
same user. Primary intents shape how long each life lasts and how
likely the user is to return for another new life. Associated with
the user’s intent are performance goals such as losing body weight,
walking or running more, or sleeping longer. We demonstrate that
users getting closer or reaching such goals are more likely to stop
using the app; that is, the app has fulfilled its purpose for them.
However, users regularly return after prolonged inactivity with
a lower level of performance (e.g., body weight increased again),
perhaps after a setback or after setting a new goal; that is, the app
may become useful again to pursue an old or new goal. We further
demonstrate that user re-engagement may be driven by external
and seasonal factors such as New Year’s resolutions in January, and
summer months during which users may be more interested in
physical activity and losing weight. Multiple life patterns also vary
with user demographics. For example, we find that young users
have much shorter lifetimes and are less likely to return for another
life than older users.

To demonstrate the predictive power of our observations, we
also formulate a novel prediction task of predicting how many lives
a user will have. We demonstrate that the insights developed in this
work allow us to predict whether a user re-engages for another life
with 71% ROC AUC. We also show that improving performance
related to the user’s primary intent is a marker of likely leaving the
app soon, because their primary goal may have been fulfilled.

While we demonstrate the multiple lives paradigm within a sin-
gle mobile activity tracking application, our conceptual model may
be applicable to other mobile health applications, in particular
when users may be pursuing, reaching, and resetting goals. Overall,
our findings around the multiple lives paradigm have important
implications for increasing user engagement in activity tracking
applications. For example, early recognition of the primary intent
could enable a more engaging personalized user experience and
better notification or gamification experience. Further, recognizing
that certain usage intents lead to few and short lifetimes can high-
light which experiences in the app are currently not well supported.
In addition, intents associated with many but very short lives could
be a prime target to win users back.

2 EXISTENCE OF MULTIPLE LIVES
In this section, we describe our dataset from an activity tracking
application and demonstrate that user engagement with the ap-
plication is segmented into multiple disjoint active periods with
distinct characteristics.

2.1 Dataset
We conduct an observational study using data from a mobile ac-
tivity tracking application, Argus by Azumio [5, 7, 38] (Table 1).
This smartphone app allows users to track various daily activities
including running, walking, cardio, heart rate, weight, sleep, drink,
and food logging activities (the app also supports other more rarely
used activities such as measuring stress or logging yoga which we
aggregate and call “other” activities; less than 2% of total logging).
For example, the drink activity is used to keep track of the user’s
daily fluid intake and the workout activity is used to log various
indoor exercises such as weightlifting or indoor-cycling. In addition,
the app passively logs steps through the phone’s accelerometers
and automatically infers calories consumption for users. However,
we do not consider passively logged activity as active engagement
and thus filter out such data. We call the user action of logging a
particular activity at a particular time a check-in. We focus on users
who use the app for at least a week. Our final dataset 1 includes
over one million users actively logging 115 million check-ins over
the course of 31 months (Table 1). This long observation period and
large scale uniquely enables us to study re-engagement patterns
after prolonged user absence. Due to the popularity of the app, its
users are relatively diverse in terms of age, gender, weight status,
country of origin, and other features [7].

2.2 Multiple lives
First, we demonstrate that user engagement with the application
is segmented into multiple disjoint active periods. We define an
active period as a maximal segment with at most δ days in between
consecutive user’s check-ins. If a user has not logged an action
for at least δ days, we refer to it as an inactive period. An inactive
period between two consecutive active periods is longer than δ days
by definition. We use “(in-)activity index” to refer to a user’s n-th
(in-)active period. We calculate the duration of an active period as
the number of days between the first and last check-in in the period.
We consider only users with λ days of total lifetime, where λ > δ ,
such that it would be at least theoretically possible for a user to
have more than one active period at a given threshold δ . Otherwise,

we would, by design, obtain a downwardly biased estimate of the
number of active periods of a user.
Results. We find that over 75% of users (total lifetime λ>30 days)
become active again after a prolonged δ =30 days of inactivity (Fig-
ure 1a). And these users often return more than once to the app.
For example, 59% of users have at least three active periods where
each time they were absent from the app for more δ =30 days. Im-
portantly, this dynamics does not depend on the definition of the
inactivity gap δ . Even when users are gone for δ =90 days, we find
that 58% of them return for at least one more active period. Thus,
even for very large inactivity thresholds δ users have multiple ac-
tive periods, and this not simply an artifact of a small value of δ . We
emphasize that, no matter the particular inactivity threshold, most
users return to have multiple active periods. Therefore, studying
multiple active periods does not restrict us to a small subsample
of the population but, in fact, is relevant to the vast majority of
users. We note that many applications use notifications and e-mails
to regain user attention after brief periods of inactivity (e.g., a few
days). However, we observe a large fraction of users returning after
much longer periods of time (e.g., 90 days), when these users would
typically have been considered “dead” for all practical purposes. In
the following, we use δ =30 days unless specified otherwise.

We find that duration of both active as well as inactive period
decrease with each additional active period as shown in Figures 1b
and 1c, respectively. The average duration of the first active period
is 24 days and the average inactive period duration between the first

Figure 2: Users start active periods with frequent and diverse
check-ins but end them with fewer and less diverse check-
ins. When they re-engage with the app in another active pe-
riod, check-ins are again more frequent and diverse again.

dence intervals. Here they are too small to be visible.

and second active period is 114 days long. Note the log scale of the
y-axis and the partially linear behavior of all curves. This suggests
that both inactive as well as active period duration distributions
can be approximated by exponential distributions.
Are multiple active periods simply segments of a single, long,
fragmented life? We consider two simple measures of user activ-
ity: The number of check-ins per week and the number of distinct
activities per week as a measure of diversity. (We find similar results
when using entropy of activity distribution or fraction of check-ins
of most frequent activity instead.) In Figure 2a, we plot the number
of check-ins per week for every active period’s first and last week,
connected by a line.active period Figure 2b shows the same for the
number of distinct activities per week.

In both plots we observe a “zig-zag” pattern demonstrating that
users start each active period with a larger number of check-ins
compared to when they ended their previous active period, intro-
ducing a behavior discontinuity. Furthermore, these check-ins are
also more diverse. Users also end each active period being less en-
gaged and focusing on a less diverse set of activities than at the
start of their active period. Importantly, note that the usage pat-
terns at the start of a new active period mimic those of the start
of the previous active period and are not simply a continuation of
the end of the previous active periods. The observation suggests
that a user’s active periods should in fact be considered separately,
instead of considering them to be a single, long, fragmented life
of a user. We observe this pattern for a wide range of potential δ
values, which further supports this claim.

Our findings point to a very interesting pattern of user engage-
ment with a health activity tracking app. We observe that most
users’ lifetimes can be segmented into multiple active periods (av-
erage duration of 24 days) separated my long periods of inactivity
(average duration 114 days). Furthermore, we observe that users
often return after a long absence and that their activity is not a
continuation of the previous usage patterns but it looks like as if
they are using the app for the first time (Figure 2).

Conceptually, this is consistent with a multiple lives metaphor,
where user’s leave the app, are absent for a long time, and then
return as if they are a new user. Thus, we will use “life” to refer to
an individual active period, use “lifetime” to refer to the duration of
an active period, and use “life index” to refer to a user’s n-th active

Relationship between total user lifetime and the number of
lives. We observe a relationship between the total user lifetime and
the number of lives (active periods). Figure 3 shows the probability
of re-engaging for another life as a function of the duration of
the previous life. In the first life (blue curve) we observe a clear U-
shape with both very short and very long first lives being associated
with a smaller probability of multiple lives. In later lives, this U-
shape relationship attenuates and short lives are associated with
the highest rates of return. Users with a very short first lives are
unlikely returners because they might not have found the app very
useful. However, in later lives, a short life does not mean the same
thing—users return more often and have likely found value in the
application before.

The existence of multiple life patterns for the vast majority of
users shows that while users stop using the app regularly, they do
frequently return as well, suggesting that there are times when
application is valuable to its users.

3 WHY MULTIPLE LIVES?
Next, we illuminate why there are multiple lives and what are the
mechanisms behind users leaving and returning multiple times? We
demonstrate that engagement patterns across multiple lives vary
based on the user’s primary intent as well as external influences.

3.1 Multiple User Intents
Users of an activity tracking application, such as the one studied
in this work, use the app with a wide variety of intentions. For
example, some users might want to lose weight and use the app
for regularly tracking their weight changes. Others might want to
be more physically active or sleep better. We first formalize this
notion of user intent and will later show that it helps explain how
users are using the app and why their engagement patterns follow
multiple lives.

Empirically, we find that most users use the app in a very focused
way, only using a small number of different activities. Specifically,
just one activity is enough to cover 50% of all check-ins for 87%
of all users (Figure 4; green line). To cover 90% of all check-ins,
two activities are enough for half the user population (blue line).

2Of course, one could also view the active periods simply as segments of a single, long,
fragmented user life. However, we would then expect usage patterns to be continuous
between active periods, which is not the case. Instead, we observe that the overall user
life is segmented into periods of activity with long inactive periods in between.

Figure 4: Number of activities required to cover a specific
fraction of a user’s check-ins. Users tend to focus on very
few activities. For example, one activity already covers 50%
of all check-ins for 87% of all users (not necessarily the same
activity for each user).

Figure 5: Fraction of lives focusing on each primary activity.
Note that users pursue a wide variety of primary activities.

Because usage of the app is concentrated on very few activities, we
can use the primary activity of each user (i.e., the most commonly
used one) as a proxy for the user’s primary intent of using the app.
The primary activity varies from user to user. As shown in Fig-
ure 5, about one third of users uses the app to track their drinking
(i.e., monitor their water, caffeine, or alcohol intake). One fifth of
the users primarily track their heart rate (e.g., immediately after
workouts or in a resting condition; both are indicators of cardio-
vascular health and fitness). We observe that other users primarily
track their weight (typically with the intent to lose weight), runs,
walks, or sleeping patterns. A smaller number of users primarily
focuses on food logging and cardio activities.

3.2 User Intent & Multiple Lives

Do users keep their primary intent in future lives? We com-
pute for every user and life which activity a user logged most often
(i.e., the primary activity), and how likely a user is to keep their
primary activity in consecutive lives. As shown in Figure 6, we find
that users keep their primary activity from life to life most of the
time, ranging from about 50% after the first life to almost 70% after
the fifth life (blue curve). Users’ primary activity matches their
first primary activity about 50% of the time (green curve). These
probabilities are substantially higher than consecutive agreement

ity in the next life ranges from 49% for the first life to 67%
for the fifth life (blue curve). Thus, most of the time, users
keep the same primary activity across lives. The probability
of having the same primary activity in the first life ranges
from 47% to 49% (green curve).

are linked to more and longer lives, suggesting that users regularly
find value in this functionality and for long periods of time.

We discuss design implications for increasing user engagement
based on this heterogeneity in multiple life patterns based on pri-
mary intent in Section 6.

3.3 Intent-oriented Performance Driving

Multiple Lives

Associated with the user’s primary intent are specific performance
goals. For example, a user logging weight would often be interested
in losing weight, a user logging running or walking would typically
be interested in doing so longer or faster, and users logging their
sleep would often be interested in sleeping longer or more consis-
tently. We hypothesize that users may stop using the application
once they significantly improved towards a goal associated with
their primary intent. Furthermore, these users may return to the
app once they have a new goal to attain. In order to test this hy-
pothesis, we choose four quantities for which we have associated
performance outcomes that are reported through the application
(Figure 8): weight activity using weight loss in kilograms, running
activity using run duration in minutes, walking activity using walk
duration in minutes, and sleep activity using sleep duration in hours
(higher is better, except for weight as most users are overweight
or obese; Table 1). We measure these activity-associated outcomes
for both the first and last logged activity in each life. Furthermore,
we consider user populations with a different number of lives sepa-
rately in order to compare unchanging populations over time.

Figure 7: Average lifetime and return probability vary de-
pending on the user’s primary activities.

based on picking one of the nine possible activities uniformly at
random (red curve). These findings show that users are typically
“resurrected” with the same primary intent as before, rather than
changing their intentions between consecutive lives. Note, however,
that usage patterns in the next life are not simply a continuation of
the previous life but show distinctive signs of a new life as discussed
in Section 2.2.
Multiple life patterns vary with primary intent. We find that
the way users use the app varies based on the user’s primary intent.
Figure 7 shows the average lifetime in weeks on the x-axis and
the probability of returning for another life on the y-axis across
primary intents of the user (here, we only consider user lives with
at least 10 check-ins to reduce noise). Empirically, we find that users
primarily logging their heart rate are most likely to re-engage for
another life (52%). Users who primarily log runs and sleep are less
likely to return, but their average lifetime is almost twice as long
compared to primary heart rate users (14.4, 14.4 vs 8.7 weeks). This
suggests that heart rate measurements are used every now and then,
but that most users do not monitor them over long periods of time.
In contrast, run- and sleep-loggers appear to find the associated
features (GPS trail, timing and pace statistics; sleep timing, duration
and quality) useful over longer periods of time. Activities such as
drink- and food-logging are associated with both few and short
lives. On the other hand, walking- and weight-logging activities

Table 2: Users that focus on a particular activity, tend to im-
prove outcomes associated with that activity (e.g., primarily-
walkers increase their walk durations but also tend to lose
weight). Every column is a different user population with
corresponding primary activity. Rows correspond to differ-
ent outcome measures. Wilcoxon signed-rank test is used to
test significance (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).
Results. We show average activity-associated outcomes for weight
(Figure 8a), running (Figure 8b), walking (Figure 8c), and sleep
activities (Figure 8d) with user groups of different number of total
lives in different colors. Across all four plots we observe a “zig-
zag” pattern, where users start their new life with a lower level of
performance than they end it with; that is, weight decreases, runs
duration increases, walk duration increases, and sleep duration
increases within each life. Furthermore, we find that in all cases
when users are returning to the app, they have a lower performance
level again (e.g., regained weight, or shorter runs/walks/sleeping).
We find very similar result when focusing on primary users of each
activity only.

This suggests that making significant progress towards these
performance goals is associated with leaving the app, in which
case the app might have fulfilled its purpose for that particular
user. However, users may set themselves new goals or experience
setbacks (e.g., increased weight or decreased fitness levels) giving
them a reason to return to the activity tracking app, which may
have helped them previously to realize their goals. Then, the app
becomes useful again to improve performance in some domain.
We note that the “zig-zag” patterns in Figure 8, where users leave
the app with improved performance and return with decreased
performance, provide additional evidence that user engagement in
this activity tracking application is indeed segmented into multiple
lives.
Users typically improve performance of primary activity.
Here we provide additional evidence that users focusing on a cer-
tain activity tend to improve performance outcomes associated
with that activity (Table 2). Specifically, users tend to improve the
most on their primary activities. For example, primary-walkers
improve the most (42 minutes) on walking durations. For users
primarily logging weight, we find that the last weight logged by
these users is on average 7.5 kilograms lower than their first logged
weight. These users lost the most weight compared to other groups
focusing on different primary activities. We note that activities are
also intimately related. For example, primarily logging weight is
not the only way app users can lose weight. In fact, we find that
primarily-walkers and primarily-runners also log significant weight
loss (-5.2kg and -3.9kg, respectively) and increased sleep duration
(0.5 and 0.7 hours, respectively). This highlights the complexity of
interrelated activities and health behaviors, where some activities
may replace another, while other activities may even further sup-
port each other and the goals associated with them (e.g., increased
physical activity from running and walking may support weight
loss). Overall, we find that users tend to improve performance out-
comes associated with their primary intent, and that users may

ing the first week experience longer lifetimes.

(6% over average rate) and summer months (14% over aver-
age rate), possibly related to New Year’s resolutions and sum-
mer related activity and weight loss goals.

leave the app afterwards.
Users with more diverse activities live longer. We just observed
that, for example, users primarily focusing on running or walking
also logged large weight loss. Intuitively, this makes sense. In or-
der to lose weight, one needs to do more than just log weight.
Instead, one needs to increase energy expenditure through exercise
or reduce energy intake from food and drinks. Logging multiple
activities could be a marker of increased interest in one’s health or a
marker of intended behavioral changes that would support specific
health goals. Here, we test the hypothesis whether users with more
diverse sets of activities (e.g., running and weight instead of just
weight logging activities) would be different from less diverse users
in terms of their lifetime duration. Empirically, we find that users
with more diverse initial usage patterns live longer (Figure 9).

3.4 External Influences
The activities tracked by activity tracking applications take place
in the real, physical world. As such, they are influenced by the
practices and demands of the real world. For example, there may be
seasonal influences driving user intents and goals. To investigate
external, seasonal influences, we consider each new user life and
count the number of lives that are started in each month of the year
(i.e., users either start using the app for the first time or return to
the app after a prolonged inactivity). We normalize with respect to
the average monthly rate. We only consider observations between
January 2014 and December 2015 to ensure that our observation
period includes exactly two instances of each month.
Results. We observe that the distribution of starting time of new
lives is clearly non-uniform (Figure 10). We find the highest number
of new lives starting in January (6% over average rate) and June

Track: Web of Things, Mobile and Ubiquitous ComputingWWW 2018, April 23-27, 2018, Lyon, France1506(14% over average rate). These findings can be explained by external
influences driving user intentions. For example, most users come
from the United States and other western, developed countries in
the Northern Hemisphere. In these countries, New Year’s resolu-
tions are commonly expressed on January 1; a tradition in which
a person resolves to change an undesired trait or behavior, to ac-
complish a personal goal, or otherwise improve their life. Many
New Year’s resolutions revolve around being more physically active
or losing weight and users with these resolutions may seek out
activity tracking applications to support them. Furthermore, people
often seek to lose weight or be more active during the summer
months around June. During this time weather is often more favor-
able to physical activity and users may attempt to lose weight for
the “swimsuit season”. The patterns of when new lives are started
suggest that users of activity tracking applications are externally
influenced by real-world practices and demands. Particularly in
this example, user (re-)joining time may be influenced by seasonal
effects.

We note that multiple lives patterns also vary with demographic
factors such as age, gender, and weight status. For example, we find
that young users have much shorter lifetimes and are less likely
to re-engage after long inactivity than older users. We will exploit
these correlations in Section 4 in order to predict whether a user
will re-engage in a new life and to predict their lifetime.

4 PREDICTING MULTIPLE LIVES
We formulate a novel prediction task of predicting how many lives a
user will have. This section leverages previously described insights,
including a marker of improved primary intent performance, in
order to predict whether a user comes back for another life. We also
predict how long a given life will last. We demonstrate that while
there is large variability in user re-engagement patterns, the factors
studied in this work allow us to successfully predict whether a user
re-engages for another life (71% ROC AUC) and how long this life
will last (82% ROC AUC). We note that the prediction tasks are
designed to validate our empirical findings. Features derived from
our findings are potentially generalizable to capture multiple lives
in other similar applications.

4.1 Task Description

Future Life Prediction. For any (completed) user life, we predict
whether this user will have additional future lives; that is, whether
they will re-engage with the app again after prolonged inactivity.
This is a new prediction task based on the multiple life paradigm
introduced in this work.
Lifetime Prediction. For any user life, after observing the first
four weeks (w = 28 days), we predict if a user is going to be a short-
term user (leaving within the next m = 30 days) or a long-term user
(living longer than n = 183 days). This follows the setting proposed
by Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. [15]. In this setting, we drop users
with lifetime in [w + m, n) = [58, 183) days to increase contrast
between the classes. We also evaluated our prediction models for
different parameter choices and found that our results, including
the relative predictive power of individual features, were robust
across a wide range of parameters.

4.2 Experimental Setup
Note that both tasks are formulated as binary prediction tasks.
To define the user lives, we use δ = 30 as before (again, we find
very similar results for other choices of δ ). In order to avoid pre-
mature classification of whether users will re-engage or not, we
only consider user lives that are complete well before the end of the
observation period. Specifically, we ensure that all considered users
have no check-ins within the last 180 days of the observation period
(this is larger than the average inter-life gap which is 114 days after
the first life and shorter for following lives; see Figure 1b). Note that
by the very nature of the re-engagement patterns described in this
work, one can never be sure whether a particular users may still re-
engage after 180 days. However, we tested various other thresholds
and found similar results. In total, this leaves us with 1,267,897
user lives of 851,582 distinct users for prediction. We use the area
under the ROC curve (ROC AUC) as our evaluation metric and use
10-fold cross validation for estimation. We report performance for
Gradient Boosted Tree models and optimize number of trees, tree
depth, and learning rate through cross-validation on the training
data. We also experimented with Logistic Regression and linear
SVM models, which consistently gave lower performance due to
prominent nonlinear relationships (e.g., users with medium-length
lifetime are most likely to return to the app; Figure 3).
Models. We define a series of models with different feature sets
in order to learn what features are most predictive of future lives
and lifetime. We use the same features for both prediction tasks.
However, in lifetime prediction, we compute these features from
only the first four weeks of each life. If features are missing we
impute zero and include a binary variable indicating missingness.
(1) Lifetime: Lifetime of current life in days (Section 2.2). (Of
course, we exclude this feature when predicting lifetime.)
(2) Usage Pattern: Weekly numbers of check-ins, number of dis-
tinct activities, entropy of activity distribution, and fraction of
check-ins from most frequent activity (Section 2.2). We also
include the week-to-week changes in these metrics as features.
(3) Primary Activity: Categorical variable indicating the user’s

most frequent activity (Section 3.2).

(4) Performance Change: As a marker of improved primary in-
tent performance, we include the change in weight, and running,
walking, and sleep durations as well as the number of check-ins
for each activity (Section 3.3).

(5) Demographics: Three categorical variables for age, gender,

and body-mass index (Section 3.4).

(6) Join Time: Number of days between the user’s first activity

and the launch of Argus app in July 2013 (Section 3.4).

(7) All: A combination of all features.

4.3 Results

Future Life Prediction. The prediction accuracies for predicting
whether a user will re-engage with the app in the future are shown
in Figure 11, separately for the first to fifth life of each user. For
predicting whether a user will re-engage after their first life, our
full model using all features achieves 71% ROC AUC. Note that a
random baseline would achieve 0.50 ROC AUC. We observe that all
feature groups carry significant predictive performance. In addition,
we find that the performance change marker (Section 3.3) predicts
user re-engagement with up to 58% ROC AUC. Further, prediction
performance drops with each life.

Track: Web of Things, Mobile and Ubiquitous ComputingWWW 2018, April 23-27, 2018, Lyon, France1507(Figure 1c). Users in earlier lives display greater changes in usage
pattern (Figure 2) and performance (Figure 8), which may also
contribute to better prediction accuracy in earlier lives as they are
more distinguishable from noise in data. Our results demonstrate
that the insights described in this work allow to successfully predict
whether a user re-engages for another life and how long this life
will last. These models could be used to identify well-suited user
populations that could be targeted with additional notifications,
e-mails and incentives, with important implications for increasing
user engagement and retention.

5 RELATED WORK

User engagement. User engagement has been defined as the “qual-
ity of the user experience that emphasizes the positive aspects of
interacting with an online application and, in particular, the desire
to use that application longer and repeatedly [24].” An extensive
literature has studied how to measure user engagement through
subjective (e.g., self-report) and objective measures (e.g., eye track-
ing, mouse movements) [12]. In the context of mobile applications,
engagement has been measured via clicks on notifications, time
past before seeing the notification, and usage time [29]. In this
work, we used simple, objective statistics to operationalize user
engagement based on the frequency of interactions with the ap-
plication. Previous work on user engagement has discussed the
concept of re-engagement where users interrupt usage for a few
minutes or hours [31, 32]. Many studies were conducted over a
brief period of time which made studying re-engagement patterns
impossible. In contrast to brief usage interruptions, in this work we
study re-engagement patterns after extensive inactivity (e.g., 30-90
days).
Modeling & predicting user engagement. User engagement
has previously been modeled based on repeat consumption pat-
terns [11, 13], binge watching [45], and patterns of switching be-
tween boredom and sensitization [22]. A user’s intent in using
a particular application can be predicted from the user’s behav-
ior [14, 28] since it is strongly influenced by their intent [2]. Typical
modeling of user engagement has considered users to have a single
“lifetime” during which the user typically becomes less and less en-
gaged on the platform [15, 48]. Much research has been devoted to
predicting time of next user activity [6, 21, 23], total lifetime [15, 46],
often using survival modeling techniques [16, 21, 23]. In the con-
text of wearable and mobile device data, user engagement research
has attempted to proactively engage users [33], infer the mood of
users [26], and suggest healthy behavior changes [19, 20, 34]. All
these studies assumed that user engagement follows a single life
paradigm.
Increasing user engagement. Previous studies have shown that
user engagement can be increased through notifications [3], in-
centives including badges [9, 10], gamification [8, 18, 20], and
social network features [5, 20]. Furthermore, understanding the
user’s intent [14, 28] can help designers surface different interaction
modes [39], provide better contextual help [40], and personalize
search results and recommendations [41, 42].
This work. This work studies user engagement and re-engagement
patterns after long periods of inactivity in the context of activity
tracking applications. We extend previous work (e.g., [1, 5, 7, 27,
35, 38, 47]) by discovering that users regularly re-engage after long
periods of inactivity structuring user engagement into multiple lives

Figure 11: Future life prediction performance. We predict at
the end of each life whether a user will re-engage eventually.

Figure 12: Lifetime prediction performance. We predict
whether a user will leave shortly or stay long-term.

Lifetime Prediction. The prediction accuracies for lifetime pre-
diction are shown in Figure 12, again separately for the first to fifth
life of each user. Our full model achieves 82% ROC AUC for the first
life. We again observe that all feature groups carry significant pre-
dictive performance. We find that the performance change marker
is more predictive of lifetime than re-engagement with up to 72%
ROC AUC (compared to 58% ROC AUC before). Again, we observe
that the task becomes harder for later lives with full model accuracy
ranging from 82% to 69% ROC AUC for the fifth life.
Discussion. In the lifetime prediction task, usage patterns and
performance changes are the most predictive features to distinguish
long-term users from short-term users, as highly engaged users
with frequent check-ins also tend to stay longer using the app
(Section 3.3). In the future life prediction task, the join time is
highly predictive of re-engagement since it differentiates early
adopters from late-joining users as well as identifying users joining
in specific months including those with New Year’s resolutions and
summer weight loss goals (Section 3.4). Prediction performance
drops in later lives is potentially due to both fewer data points
in later lives (Figure 1a) and more noise due to shorter lifetime

Track: Web of Things, Mobile and Ubiquitous ComputingWWW 2018, April 23-27, 2018, Lyon, France1508with distinct characteristics. We demonstrate that these multiple
lives are driven by user intent and external influences. Further, we
propose a novel prediction task of predicting the number of lives
of a user.

6 DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION
Finally, we summarize our findings in the form of a conceptual
model of user engagement across multiple lives. We also discuss
design implications for increasing user engagement in this setting.

6.1 Conceptual Model of Multiple Life User
Engagement in Activity Tracking Apps
The presented empirical evidence can be explained by the following
model of user engagement across multiple lives:
(1) Users join the application with a specific, primary intent and

associated goals, starting a new life (Section 3.1).

(2) The user uses the app in accordance with their primary intent
(Section 3.1). Users typically improve in performance metrics as-
sociated with their primary intent during this time (Section 3.3).
(3) Once the user have made significant improvements towards
their goal they may leave the app, corresponding to the end of
their lifetime (Section 3.3).

(4) When the user forms a new goal (often based on external, sea-
sonal influences; Section 3.4), or experiences a setback (e.g.,
regaining lost weight), they may join the app again starting a
new life (Section 3.3). In many cases, the primary intent of their
new life remains the same as before (Section 3.2).

6.2 Implications for Increasing Engagement
Our findings around the novel multiple live paradigm have impli-
cations for increasing user engagement in activity tracking appli-
cations. For example, early recognition of the primary user intent
could enable a more engaging personalized user experience. We
find that it only takes 6 days from when a user starts using the
app to predict a user’s eventual primary activity with 80% accuracy.
Once the user intent is inferred, one could cross-promote app fea-
tures that support the user’s primary intent (e.g., walking, running,
or cardio for users attempting to lose weight).

Furthermore, observing how different user intents lead to user
engagement with varying number of lives and lifetime can shine
a light on how different features are used and where users see or
do not see value. Consider the four quadrants of Figure 7. The bot-
tom left quadrant, containing the primary intents drink and food,
corresponds to few and short lifetimes. This suggests that these
experiences in the app are currently not well supported. The top
left quadrant, containing primarily heart rate-logging users, shows
that these users tend to log heart rate across multiple lives, but only
for a relatively short time each. These may be activities that are
useful to track, but do not necessarily need to be tracked regularly
over long periods of time since they do not vary as dynamically
and quickly (e.g., resting and maximum heart rate changes rather
slowly). Here, one could consider interventions targeted at getting
previous users with such intents to re-engage (e.g., notifications or
e-mails such as “We saw you have not checked your resting heart
rate in a while. It might have changed!”). The top right quadrant
contains walking, weight, and logging of other activities which are
associated with both more and longer lives. Likely, users find value
in these features as they use them for a long, consecutive time,

and often re-engage after prolonged inactivity. User intents in the
bottom right quadrant (run, sleep, and cardio) correspond to intents
associated with long but few lives. In these cases, users find value in
tracking these behaviors for a long, consecutive time, but once they
have completed their life, they are less likely to re-engage again.
Here, one can consider, for example, performance/goal-driven in-
terventions such as “Can you still run a 10k in 53 minutes?” or “Can
we help you manage your weight?”.

Lastly, gamification techniques such as badges and rewards could
be used to incentivize specific multiple-life behaviors. For example,
they could be awarded for each re-engagement after prolonged
inactivity. Importantly, this would need to be complemented with
rewards for long-time use. Otherwise, users may feel incentivized
to leave the app when they would not have done so otherwise.

In summary, modeling usage periods as multiple lives can enable
a better understanding of the user engagement mechanisms in
mobile activity tracking applications and support of the user’s
motivations and intents.
Limitations. This study is a large-scale case study of the mobile
activity tracking application Argus. Therefore, we are limited in
our ability to generalize our findings and the multiple life para-
digm to other mobile health applications. However, Argus is one
of the most popular and general activity tracking apps on the mar-
ket. Futher, our results show that multiple lives are likely due to
real-world intentions and goals, and therefore are influenced by
external factors. Therefore, our discoveries may generalize to other
mobile health applications, where engagement is also driven by
real-world intentions and factors. In fact, we are currently working
with another dataset from the mobile app MyFitnessPal by Under
Armour, used for calorie counting and weight loss. In this dataset
we also observe that user engagement is clearly segmented into
multiple lives.

6.3 Conclusion
User engagement is important to the success of mobile health ap-
plications and has historically been modeled as a single lifetime
of user engagement. In this paper, we study user engagement pat-
terns of over a million users over 31 months in a mobile activity
tracking application. In contrast to previous work on modeling
user engagement in online contexts, we discover that user engage-
ment in activity tracking applications exhibits multiple lives. We
demonstrate that multiple lives occur because users set new goals,
experience setback from previous progress, or are influenced by
external factors (e.g., seasonal effects). We discuss implications of
the multiple life paradigm on increasing user engagement within
activity tracking applications and propose a novel prediction task of
predicting the number of lives of a user as well as their lifetime. We
show that predictive models based on the insights developed in this
work can successfully predict whether a user will re-engage with
the app and the length of their lifetime. Our work has implications
for modeling user re-engagement in mobile health applications,
and consequences for how notifications, recommendations as well
as gamification can be used to increase engagement.
