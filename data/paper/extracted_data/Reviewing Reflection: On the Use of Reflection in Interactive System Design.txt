ABSTRACT
Designers  have  demonstrated  an  increased  interest  in
designing  for  reflection.  However,  that  work  currently
occurs under a variety of diverse auspices. To help organize
and investigate this literature, this paper present a review of
research  on  systems  designed  to  support  reflection.  Key
findings  include  that  most  work  in  this  area  does  not
actually  define  the  concept of reflection. We also  find  that
most evaluations do not focus on reflection per se rather but
on  some  other  outcome  arguably  linked  to  reflection.  Our
review  also  describes  the  relationship  between  reflection
and  persuasion  evidenced  implicitly  by  both  rhetorical
motivations  for  and  implementation  details  of  system
design. After discussing the significance of our findings, we
conclude  with  a  series  of  recommendations  for  improving
research on and design for reflection.

INTRODUCTION
Interaction  design  originally  focused  largely  on  workplace
and  task-based  settings  [32]  where  productivity  was  the
primary goal. Later work developed from “human factors to
human actors” [3], considering the human not as a portion
of  a  larger  cognitive  mechanism  but  rather  acknowledging
and incorporating many of the psychosocial dimensions of
technology  use.  Third-wave  HCI  [11,35]  then  argued  for
considering  how  other  aspects  of  human  experience—
emotion  [82],  domestic  life  [89],  sexuality  [46],  culture
[41], religion [7,101]—might factor into technology design.

During  this  third  wave  shift,  the  theme  of  designing  for

reflection  has  emerged.  That  is,  designers  have  become
interested  in  the  ways  that  technology  might  be  able  to
support  human  reflection  on  experience  [23,75].  While
reflective  thought  has  arguably  existed  as  a  locus  of
interaction  design  for  years  [cf. 20],  explicit  focus  on
supporting  reflection  is  relatively  nascent,  though  with  an
already  emerging  body  of  literature  [23,75].  For  work  in
this  area  to  move  forward  and  mature  into  a  developed
subfield,  it  would  be  valuable  to  consider  how  such  work
approaches reflection. How is reflection defined? Where is
reflection  expected  to  be  most  helpful,  and  in  what  ways?
What  techniques  and  design  strategies  are  used  to
encourage  and  support  reflection?  When  do  we  know  that
reflection has occurred, i.e., how is reflection evaluated?

This  paper  reviews  literature  in  the  emerging  area  of
designing for reflection. First we describe the process of our
literature review, resembling in many ways that of [21]. The
subsequent  section  presents  a  number  of  trends,  patterns,
and  themes  we  identified  in  our  analysis,  followed  by  an
interpretation  of  these  findings  and  their  implications,  as
well  as  suggested  directions  for  future  work  on  designing
for reflection.

We  find  that  little  work  actually  explicitly  defines  what
reflection  is,  and  even  less  grounds  the  definition  in  a
conceptual or theoretical framework. The rareness of a clear
definition  leads  to  a  majority  of  work  using  colloquial  or
implicit  definitions  of  reflection  and  as  a  result  presenting
the  concept  as  fairly  limited  in  its  scope.  Similarly,
relatively few evaluations focus on reflection per se, instead
assessing  outcomes  supposedly  resulting  from  reflection.
Finally,  while  reflection  is  purported  as  a  benefit  in  a
variety  of  areas—from  education  to  design  to  personal
informatics—almost no work considers potential downsides
of reflecting.

Reflection  is  considered  central  to  many  fields  including
healthcare,  education,  and  design.  If  interactive  systems
design is to contribute meaningfully to supporting reflection
in these and other areas, it will be essential to have a more
nuanced  understanding  of  reflection  itself,  means  of
assessing it, and strategies to support it.

OUR PROCESS
Before  beginning  our  literature  review,  we  sought  to
achieve at least partial consensus among the authors about

ReflectionDIS 2014, June 21–25, 2014, Vancouver, BC, Canada93what constituted reflection. The goal was not to articulate a
highly specific definition, but rather to provide some set of
criteria  for  whether  a  paper  should  or  should  not  be
included in our review. Drawing on ideas from Dewey [20],
Schön  [76],  Moon  [67],  and  others,  we  see  reflection  as
reviewing  a  series of  previous  experiences, events, stories,
etc., and putting them together in such a way as to come to
a better understanding or to gain some sort of insight. This
broad,  general  conceptualization  was  intentional,  as  this
review is meant to be inclusive rather than exclusive. These
basic ideas were used to guide our literature search.

Building the Corpus
Due  to  our  specific  interest  in  how  reflection  has  been
conceptualized  and  deployed  in  interactive  system  design,
we  used  a  search  of  the  ACM  Digital  Library  to  collect
papers.  Specifically,  we  collected  all  papers  published
under  the  H.5  ACM  classification  (Information  Interfaces
and  Presentation)  that  used  “reflect,”  “reflecting,”  or
“reflection” as a keyword. We chose not to use the keyword
“reflective”  as  such  papers  often  focused  more  on
designers’,  researchers’,  and  practitioners’  reflection  on
their own work (discussed further below). We used the H.5
designation  to  capture  as  much  relevant  literature  as
possible  (noting  that  the  template  for  many  human-
computer  interaction  venues  uses  H.5.m  as  the  default
classification).  This  keyword-based  approach  could  omit
some  papers  that  arguably  pertain  to  reflection  as  defined
above. However, our goal was not to find every paper that
fit  this  definition  but  to  identify  those  papers  that  the
authors  viewed  as  being about  reflection.   These were the
papers  that  we  wanted  to  include  in  the  review,  those  that
explicitly purported to engage with the concept.

This  initial  search  generated  100  results.  Of  those,  we
sought  papers  that  involved  studies  of  some  person  or
persons  (often  users  though  not  always)  who  were
reflecting.  We  excluded  papers  where  the  keyword
“reflection”  was  used  to  refer  to  the  optical  phenomenon,
e.g.,  “frustrated  total  internal  reflection”  as  a  technique  in
touch-based  interfaces. We  also  excluded  papers  that  were
reflections on the field of HCI where the  authors were the
primary people doing the reflecting. This process resulted in
76 papers being included in our review.

Reading and Analysis
We began our analysis by developing a series of questions
intended  to  provide  a  sense  for  how  reflection  was
conceptualized and deployed.

1. What definition of reflection does the paper offer?
2. To what application domain does the paper pertain?
3. Who  are  the  people  doing  the  reflecting  (e.g.,  system

users, designers, students, the elderly)?
Is  reflection  the  desired  result  of  an  intervention
described  in  the  paper  (as  opposed  to,  say,  a  paper
studying reflection in some specific context)?
If  the  paper  describes  an  interactive  system,  what

5.

design  features  or  strategies  are  used  to  support
reflection?

6. What are the stated benefits of reflection?

These questions were not meant to be restrictive, i.e., these
were not the only aspects of these papers in which we were
interested.  Rather,  they  were  meant  to  provide  generative
guidance—what patterns, trends, or themes might be noted
by  attending  to  these  questions? After  formulating  our  list
of  questions,  the  papers  were  evenly  divided  among  the
authors. Each author read her or his papers, both answering
our  list  of  questions  and  noting  other  trends.  The  authors
also  met  periodically  throughout  the  reading  process  to
discuss both observations and questions.

After reading all the papers in our corpus, we conducted an
analysis  based  on  a  grounded  theory  approach  [27].
Combining  our  answers  to  the  above  questions  with  other
notes  and  observations,  we  developed  a  list  of  salient
themes emerging from our discussions of the papers. These
themes became the  basis for  a  series  of  memos,  with each
memo both describing one theme or pattern and indicating
the reason for its interest or significance. The memos were
then  circulated  among  the  authors,  who  discussed  them
further,  refined  them,  and  considered  relationships  among
them. These memos, and the themes they describe, form the
basis for the following sections.

RESULTS – THEMES AND PATTERNS
In  total,  our  corpus  included  76  papers,  all  published
between 2000 and 2013. The average publication year was
2010 and the median 2011. A plurality of papers come from
the  ACM  SIGCHI  conference,  either  the  full  proceedings
(13 papers) or the extended abstracts (16). The later include
a mix of workshop descriptions, works in progress, posters,
etc. The next largest contingent appears in the Creativity &
Cognition  conference  (8).  The  remainder  occurred  in  such
venues  as  Designing  Interactive  Systems  (3),  Artificial
Intelligence  and  Education  (3),  iConference  (2),  Tangible
and  Embedded  Computing  (2),  and  other  similar  venues.
The  papers  themselves  describe  a  variety  of  endeavors,
including  interactive  systems  to  support  reflection  [e.g.,
12], methods intended to incorporate reflection into design
processes  [e.g., 19],  techniques  for  user  studies  [e.g.,
39,40],  empirical  studies  of  reflective  practitioners  [e.g.,
73,68], and others.

This  section  describes  a  number  of  trends  and  patterns
observed in the corpus during our analysis. The subsequent
section  turns  to  the  interpretation  of  these  patterns,  their
significance, and their implications for future work.

Reflection and its Definition
As  described  above,  this  review  sought  to  explore  the
definitions  of  reflection  used  in  the  HCI  literature.
However,  the  papers  we  reviewed  rarely  actually  defined
reflection.  Of  the  76  papers,  only  30  included  an  explicit
definition.  Often,  this  definition  consisted  of  a  brief,

ReflectionDIS 2014, June 21–25, 2014, Vancouver, BC, Canada94surface-level  description  without  grounding  in  extant
theory, e.g.: “conscious, purposeful thought that is directed
at  a  problem  in  order  to  understand  it  and  form  integrated
conceptual  structures”  [79:49];  “inform  the  users  about
their  own  behavior”  [62:322];  a  process  “in  which  people
recapture  their  experience,  think  about  it  mull  it  over  and
evaluate  it”  [6:1786];  or  “looking  at  lists  of  collected
personal  information  or  exploring  or  interacting  with
information  visualizations”  [55:562].Of  those  30  with  a
definition, only 22 papers provided a citation on which their
definition  was  based.  Interestingly,  six  more  papers
referenced  such  a  citation  but  did  not  include  a  clear
definition  of  reflection,  presumably  expecting  the  reader
either  to  be  familiar  with  the  concept  or  to  reference  the
citation.  Of  those  28  papers  that  did  cite  a  reference  for
reflection,  a  large  majority  (20)  drew  on  Schön’s  [76]
concept  of  reflection-in-action.  The  remainder  cite  work
from a variety of areas, such as creativity [100].

Reflection and its Evaluation
We  also  examined  how  evaluations  of  reflection  were
conducted.  The  overwhelming  majority  of  papers  we
reviewed treated reflection as the means to an end, such as
improved  education  [30,48,78],  better  design  [66,83],  a
greater understanding of one’s illness or cognitive abilities
[25,52], etc.

As  such,  quantitative  assessments  in  these  studies  rarely
measured  reflection per  se.  Instead,  either  they  measured
other outcome variables, suggesting that an improvement in
those  outcomes  indicated  increased  levels  of  reflection,  or
the  evaluation  was  less  concerned  with  whether  reflection
happened, using it primarily as a justification rather than an
outcome  [30,62].  In  several  studies,  individuals  were
considered  to  have  reflected  on  their  behaviors  or  patterns
after  being  presented  with  their  data,  but  little  evidence  is
provided to suggest that these people engaged in some kind
of  reflective  thought  [cf. 67,76]  beyond  simply  looking  at
the data [56,94].

Qualitative  assessments  of  reflection  often  occurred  in  the
context  of  interview  studies  [53,90].  This  approach,
however,  encounters  similar  difficulties  noted  above,
namely,  lacking  a  clear  definition  of  reflection  and  not
asking directly about reflection. For instance, Leijen et al.’s
[53] interviews dealt with self-assessment and use of video
recordings in dance instruction. While reflection comprised
a part of that dialogue, the interview questions appear  less
directly  focused  on  reflection,  instead  focusing  on  “the
streaming  video  usage  in  the  course:  video  editing  and
viewing  to  support  the  describing  of  experiences,  use  of
video,  evaluation  questions  and  criteria  for  online  self-
assessment, and online peer feedback activities for learning
from multiple perspectives” [53:172].

A few exceptions to this trend either explored reflection for
its  own  sake  or  measured  reflection  as  a  contribution  to
another  outcome.  For  example,  Isaacs  et  al.  [42]  asked

study  participants  to  revisit  old  entries  posted  in  a
journaling system and re-rate their feelings about the event
in  question.  Doing  so  not  only  made  the  reflection  visible
and thus enabled direct analysis thereof, but it also allowed
investigation  of  the  effects  of  that  reflection  on  overall
wellbeing. Indeed, Isaacs et al. [42] provide one of the more
methodologically rigorous evaluations in our corpus.

In light of the above noted vagueness with which reflection
is  often  defined,  this  trend  of  not  measuring  or  exploring
reflection  directly  might  be  expected.  Indeed,  the  lack  of
clarity  resulting  from  using  either  no  definition  or  a
colloquial definition of reflection would likely make direct
assessment challenging at best. Thus, many studies instead
investigated  outcomes  or  aspects  of  experiences  that
purportedly  would  benefit  from  increased  reflection.  The
following  sections  detail  three  specific  types  of  benefits
these papers suggest reflection can or should provide.

Reflection and Education
First, of the papers we reviewed, 15 dealt with education in
some  way  [14,15,16,17,30,43,48,50,51,53,70,77,78,79,90,
93,98].  Specific  foci  ranged  from  reflection  as  a  means  of
educating  working  professionals  [16]  to  music  [14,43]  or
dance [53] instruction, to teaching programming [90].

This  prevalence  does  not  come  as  entirely  surprising.
Dewey’s  [20]  philosophical  investigations  on  the  value  of
reflective  thought  links  it  explicitly  with  education,  and
others  have  similarly  argued  for  the  value  and  importance
of  reflection  in  education  [e.g. 67].  Indeed,  some  form  of
learning (through reflection) occurred in many papers, both
those that deal with formal education and those that do not.
Furthermore,  Schön’s  [76]  work  on  the  reflective
practitioner is often cited in professional education. Indeed,
of the five education-oriented papers that cited a definition
of  reflection,  three  [14,51,90]  cite  Schön  [76]  and  two
[53,90] cite Dewey [20], while others [79] cite Moon [53]
and Norman [71].

In  contrast  to  the  general  trend  described  above,  many  of
the  papers  on  reflection  in  education  focused  their
evaluations  specifically  on  reflection.  Lamberty  and
Kolodner  [51]  describe  how  camera  talk—having  students
speak  directly  to  a  camera  when  describing  their  work—
enabled  a  variety  of  activities  labeled  as  reflective,
particularly  those  in  which  the  student  was  explaining
aspects of their mathematical understanding. Leijen et al.’s
[53] use of video to support dance education was evaluated
in  terms  of  how  the  processes  and  experiences  it  afforded
resembled  reflection,  particularly  the  ability  to  draw  on
multiple perspectives from peers. Tchetagni et al. [90] go so
far as to develop an analytic scheme based on Dewey’s [20]
stages  of  reflection  that  they  used  to  assess  the  degree  of
reflectiveness evidenced among students using their system.
Rather than focusing solely on outcomes, this work dealing
with  reflection  in  education  generally  tended  to  include
more consideration of process in addition to product.

ReflectionDIS 2014, June 21–25, 2014, Vancouver, BC, Canada95Reflection and Design
Second, 17 of the papers we reviewed related to reflection
in  and  on  the  design  process  [2,19,28,29,33,34,37,61,
66,69,80,83,84,86,92,95,102].  These  pape rs  focuse d
overwhelmingly  on  designers  working  alone  or  in  groups
(13) and secondarily designers and users reflecting together
a la co-design or participatory design (4). About half of the
papers focus on reflection that takes place during the design
process,  spanning  from  problem  formulation  [95],  to
reflecting  on  design  outputs  [33],  to  comparing  multiple
design solutions [86]. In the works that cover reflection on
the  design  process  focus  generally  on  improving  design
ability  by  reflecting  on  prior  design  processes  “to  extract
lessons  and  insights  that  can  be  applied  to  future  design
situations” [84:84].

Most  of  these  papers  do  not  provide  such  an  explicit
definition  of  reflection,  but  many  make  reference  to
Schön’s [76] concepts of reflection-in-action and reflection-
on-action.  This  prevalence  is  perhaps  not  surprising,
considering  Schön’s  description  of  design  as  a  reflective
conversation  with  materials  and  process.  In  these  papers,
reflection is  overwhelmingly  considered a positive  activity
that  can  lead  to  better  design,  including  both  improved
design  outputs  [19,34,61,69,86]  and  an  improved  design
process or creative process [37,66,84,102].

These  studies  suggest  a  range  of  specific  benefits.
Reflection can create a deeper understanding of the design
space [92] or deeper insight into the problem at hand [95].
Reflection  leads  to  improved  or  increased  communication,
such as the sharing of viewpoints or understanding between
designers,  or  between  designers  and  stakeholders  [2,95].
Reflection itself leads to increased creativity [28,29], or the
more  effective  communication  and  coordination  that
reflection enables can improve creativity [33].

Yoo  et  al.  [102],  however,  consider  that  in  some  cases
reflection  might  inhibit  creative  thinking  and  explore  how
to  “prompt  stakeholders  to  reflect  on  action  without
undermining  exploration  and  creative  thinking”  [102:420].
This was one of the few examples in our corpus where the
authors  acknowledged  that  reflection  might  not  provide
universal benefit or value.

Reflection and Self Knowledge
Third,  reflection  is  often  described  as  providing  increased
self  knowledge,  a  benefit  cited  in  15  of  the  papers  we
reviewed  [1,13,25,26,31,52,55,56,57,58,59,63,72,97,103].
Such  knowledge  is  often  cited  as  motivation  for  work  in
both  health  and,  moreover,  in  personal  informatics.  The
latter involves collection of data about the self followed by
presentation  of  that  data  back  to  the  self.  Closely  linked
with  the  quantified  self  movement  [56,58],  the  value  of
knowledge  gained  by  this  data-driven  introspection  comes
from a long-standing tradition in Western thought. Li et al.
[55]  open  their  paper  with  a  narrative  of  how  ancient
Greeks,  who  would  pilgrimage  to  the Temple  of Apollo  at

Delphi  to  find  answers,  were  there  greeted  with  the
inscription  “Gnothi  seauton”  or  “Know  thyself.”  Knowing
thyself,  this  literature  suggests,  is  non-trivial.  We  “often
have  incomplete  knowledge  of  ourselves,  we  cannot
monitor  our  behaviors  all  the  time,  and  we  cannot  easily
find  patterns  in  our  behaviors”  [57:4490].  Personal
informatics systems fill this gap, thereby “fostering insight,
increasing  self-control,  and  promoting  positive  behaviors”
[57:4490]. Reflection, in this model, consists of the process
of examining one’s own data.

While  this  rhetorical  positioning  comes  across  clearly  in
personal informatics, many papers in our review that were
not identified by the authors under that umbrella still cited
similar  motivations.  For  example, Mathur  and  Karahalios
describe  a  visualization  system  based  on  bookmarks  in  a
web  browser  wherein  “the  user  is  able  to  notice  things
about  oneself  that  he  or  she  did  not  notice  before”
[65:4657].

Interestingly,  although  reflection  plays  a  prominent  role  in
personal informatics and related work, the final stage of Li
et  al.’s  [55]  model,  and  the  goal  of  much  similar  work,  is
action. Their line of reasoning suggests that showing users
data  about  themselves  will  lead  them  to do  something,
presumably  something  different  from  and  better  than  what
they  are  already  doing.  For  example,  showing  diabetics
blood sugar levels will increase their ability to manage their
condition  [25];  showing  frequency  of  shortcut  key  usage
will increase their usage [62]; showing mouse accuracy will
reduce  exaggerated  movements  and  improve  future
performance  [44].  Indeed,  the  idea  of  inciting  behavioral
change occurred implicitly in much of the papers reviewed
here.  However,  these  papers  also  varied  in  the  degree  of
prescribing  exactly  of  what  that  behavioral  change  should
consist, raising comparisons with persuasion.

Reflection and Persuasion
As indicated above, sometimes the goal of reflection is not
only to increase self knowledge but to take action based on
this  increased  awareness.  Systems  of  reflection  vary  as  to
the  extent  that  they  support  taking  such  action.  Some
suggest  specific  actions  that  users  should  take,  such  as
using hotkeys more often [62], and others leave the decision
making up to the user.  Li et al. [55] refer to these properties
as  system-driven  and  user-driven  in  personal  informatics
systems,  respectively.  They  found  that  one  barrier  during
the  action  stage  was  a  lack  of  specific,  actionable
suggestions  of  what  to  do  next  to  help  the  user  apply  the
outcome of their reflection to action.

Similarly, the vast majority of systems we reviewed did not
recommend particular  actions  after  reflection.  Fifty-five  of
the  papers  in  this  review  described  some  type  of
intervention to support reflection, whether it be a mobile or
desktop  system  [e.g., 29,31]  or  public  installation  [36,94].
Of  these  55,  only  3  (5%)  of  the  interventions  suggested
specific action [9,62,91]. This is not to say that designers of

ReflectionDIS 2014, June 21–25, 2014, Vancouver, BC, Canada96the remaining 52 did not have particular goals in mind for
users of the interventions, just that the resulting systems did
not command users to take specific actions to achieve them.
For example, Frost and Smith’s intervention seeks “to help
diabetics  develop  better  understanding  of  how  daily
activities impact fluctuations in their blood sugar” [25:2] so
that  they  can  better  learn  how  to  control  their  disease.
However  the  specific  actions  that  users  take  based  on  this
understanding are not prescribed through the system.

On  the  other  end  of  the  spectrum,  a  few  papers  in  our
review  explicitly,  both  in  the  paper  and  through  their
design,  sought  to  be  open-ended  about  the  upshots  of
reflection.  For  example,  A  Diary  Built  for  Two  [13]  used
selectively shared digital diaries among romantic couples to
emphasize  “re-storying,”  i.e.,  developing  alternative
understandings  of  shared  experiences,  but  without  specific
prompts  directing  the  kinds  of  diary  entries  users  should
make  or  share.  Similarly,  the  designers  of  GoSlow  aim  to
“promote  discourse  on  one’s  actions  and  values  in  one’s
every  pursuits”  but  without  prescribing  “how  and  to  what
extent  they  should  cut  back,  slow  down,  and  reflect”
[18:431].

Even  in  situations  where  designerly  intent  is  made
expressly clear, reflection may not always take the form or
have  the  results  intended.  For  example,  experienced
patients using the MAHI [64] system employed it less as a
problem-solving  tool,  instead  leveraging  a  commenting
feature to craft stories that allowed them to construct their
identity as diabetics [63]. Similarly, a visualization of email
and  phone  activity  intended  to  support  reflection  on  long
term, higher level patterns was consistently used instead to
reminisce about specific events [103]. While these systems
can  end  up  reappropriated  in  ways  not  necessarily
accounted  for  by  designerly  intent,  such  alternative  uses
may still constitute some manner of reflection.

Ultimately,  we  do  not  pass  judgment  on  whether
prescribing specific action in systems of reflection is good,
bad, practical, necessary, or desirable. We instead note that
these  systems  of  reflection  exist  on  a  spectrum  when  it
comes to prescribing action, creating a nuanced relationship
with persuasive technology [24]. Some systems, such as the
3  interventions  noted  above,  are  very  prescriptive  in  the
action their users should take, and these would fall into the
persuasive  class  defined  by  Fogg  [24].  Others  still  have
general  outcome  goals  for  their  users  but  do  less  to  guide
them  toward  a  specific  action  [e.g., 25].  Finally,  some
systems support the process of reflection itself without any
pre-conceived goal for action or behavior change [e.g., 36].

DISCUSSION
This  section  turns  from  describing  what  we  found  during
our  literature  review  to  considering  the  implications  of
these  patterns,  as  well  as  what  they  suggest  as  valuable
directions for future work in this area.

The Definition(s) of Reflection
As mentioned above, few papers in our survey included an
explicit definition of reflection, and of those that did many
cited Schön [76]. This finding raises three important points.
First, it might be seen as somewhat disconcerting that over
half  of  the  papers  using  reflection  as  a  keyword  never
define  the  concept.  One  could  interpret  this  absence  of  a
definition  as  indicating  a  clear  consensus  about  what
reflection is; since everyone knows what reflection means it
needs  no  definition.  Alternatively,  and  we  suggest  more
likely, this lack of definitions indicates relatively little deep
consideration  of  or  engagement  with  the  phenomenon  of
reflection, how it should be defined, what might constitute
it, and how best to design for it.

Second,  the  preponderance  of  Schön’s  work  in  papers  that
do  cite  a  reference  for  their  definition  of  reflection  might
again  suggest  a  sort  of  consensus,  that  those  who  do  seek
conceptual  or  theoretical  grounding  agree  to  draw  on
reflection-in-action  [76].  However,  this  Schönian  majority
might  also  suggest  some  limitations  or  constraints  in  how
HCI  approaches  reflection.  Indeed,  a  variety  of
conceptualizations of and definitions for reflection could be
used  to  inform  design,  from  education  [e.g., 67]  to
aesthetics  and  design  [10]  to  philosophy  [20,47].  We
suggest that there may be rich possibilities for considering
other  conceptualizations  of  reflection  or,  perhaps,  for
comparing  or  synthesizing  from  among  them  [cf. 23].
Doing  so  would,  we  suggest,  help  tease  apart  the
relationships  among  reflection,  reminiscence  (see  further
below), reflexivity [REF], and other related concepts.

Third,  without  a  clear  explicit  definition,  many  of  the
papers  we  reviewed  implicitly  conflated  reflection  with
feedback.  For  example,  dancers  who  observe  video
recordings  of  their  performances  are  said  to  be  reflecting
[53].  In  personal  informatics,  “looking  at  lists  of  collected
personal  information”  [55:562]  constitutes  the  reflection
stage. Both the content and repercussions of these implicit
definitions  about  what  constitutes  reflection  can  be  seen
more clearly by examining details of the techniques used in
interventions intended to support reflection.

The Constitution of Reflection
Many  of  the  papers  in  this  review  described  interventions
designed  to  support  or  encourage  reflection  in  some  way.
However, the lack of definition or deeper engagement with
the  concept  of  reflection  poses  challenges  for  design.  For
example,  what  does  it  take  to  reflect?  How  can
interventions  provide  spaces  that  are  conducive  to
reflection?  As  mentioned  above,  the  Personal  Informatics
model  described  reflection as “looking at lists  of  collected
personal  information  or  exploring  or  interacting  with
information  visualizations,”  [55:562].  This  definition
carries  an  implicit  assumption  that  by  providing  access  to
data  that  has  been  “prepared,  combined,  and  transformed”
[55:561] for the purpose of reflection, reflection will occur.
The majority of the interventions in our review held similar

ReflectionDIS 2014, June 21–25, 2014, Vancouver, BC, Canada97assumptions  [e.g., 94].  In  these  papers,  reflection  was
implicitly  defined  as  something  that  would  happen  by
providing  the  user  with  some  type  of  information  about  a
particular  situation,  and  as  a  result  the  user  would  have  a
newfound  awareness  in  the  intervention’s  domain  of
interest.

Prior  work  has  made  certain  recommendations  for
supporting  reflection  through  designed  interventions,  such
as  providing  encouragement  and  allowing  time  for
reflection  to  occur  [23,60].  Li  et  al.’s  [55]  model  also
presents  barriers  to  reflection  that  should  be  addressed  in
systems,  including  lack  of  time  and  effective  visualization
of  personal  data.  However,  we  believe  that  as  designers
there is much to be gained from being explicit in what we
mean  by  reflection  and  engaging  with  it  as  an  important
part of a larger set of processes and practices, and not just
as  a  natural  consequence  or  byproduct  of  presenting
information  to  users.  By  making  the  reflective  process  of
our systems the focus of inquiry, we can better learn what it
takes to reflect and how to support both reflective processes
and other system goals in our designs.

The Evaluation of Reflection
Perhaps as a consequence of the lack of a clear definition of
reflection, the majority of the papers do not provide a direct
assessment  or  evaluation  of  reflection per se. It is difficult
to observe what you cannot define. However, such indirect
evaluation  may  also  arise  from  a  focus  on  the  utility  of
reflection,  i.e.,  reflection  as  a  means  to  an  end. A  greater
shift  toward  viewing  reflection  itself  as  a  meaningful
activity  may  lead  to  more  focused  evaluations  of  the
process thereof.

A  few  evaluations  in  the  papers  we  reviewed  did  focus
specifically on reflection. As mentioned above, Isaacs et al.
[42]  directly  analyzed  participants’  reflections  by  asking
them to add notes to already recorded journal entries and re-
rate  their  feelings  about  the  event  on  a  Likert  scale.
Similarly,  a  Diary  Built  For  Two  [13]  focuses  on  the
reflection  and  “re-storying”  that  can  occur  by  romantic
couples  selectively  sharing  diary  entries  with  one  another.
In  another  example  [described  in 23],  teachers  and  their
mentors  used  SenseCam,  a  lifelogging  technology,  to
enable  reviews  by  mentors  and  to  help  facilitate  social
reflection [22], to which we return below.

This  is  not  meant  as  a  blanket  methodological  critique  of
evaluative  approaches  taken  in  the  papers  we  reviewed.
Reflection  is  a  complex,  potentially  nebulous  concept  [cf.
20,76], making evaluation thereof that much more difficult.
Indeed, some  in education have  suggested  that meaningful
direct  assessment  of  reflection  can  become  intractably
difficult  [88].  We  suggest  that  this  gap  presents  an
opportunity  for  future  research  to  consider  how,  if  at  all,
evaluations might directly focus on reflection itself.

The Sociality of Reflection
Most of the papers we reviewed described reflection as an
individual,  largely  mental  or  cognitive  activity,  e.g.,
reflecting  on  one’s  performance  as  a  given  task  [44,62] or
observing data about one’s self [25,55,56].

A few papers did acknowledge the possibility of reflection
as a social activity. For example, Prilla et al. [73] describe
both a study of and a system to support hospital workers in
collectively reflecting on their conversations with patients’
family  members.  Also,  by  focusing  on  collaborative  co-
design [e.g., 2,9] or political engagement [49,74], a number
of the papers oriented similarly towards group reflection.

We  suggest  this  gap  represents  an  opportunity  in  at  least
two  ways.  First,  the  area  is  ripe  for  work  on  both
understanding and designing to  support reflection not only
as  an  individual,  cognitive  activity  but  also  as  a  social
process.  Second,  examining  situations  of  social  reflection
may  help  address  some  of  the  difficulties  noted  above  in
evaluating reflection per se. We see this benefit as similar to
that  provided  by  distributed  cognition’s  [38]  analytic
orientation.  Generally,  cognition  is  seen  as  an  internal
process  that,  as  such,  is  not  readily  visible  to  researchers
and, thus, is not readily accessible for analysis. By focusing
on  the  ways  that  cognition  is  distributed  among  multiple
people,  devices,  and  artifacts,  distributed  cognition  makes
more  visible,  and  thus  more  accessible  for  analysis,
cognitive  processes.  We  argue  a  similar  approach  might
provide  benefits  in  terms  of  studying  reflection.  Situations
of social reflection require externalization [cf. 96], i.e., that
individuals explicate their thinking and engage with that of
others.  While  activities  such  as  camera  talk  [51]  and
responding  to  reflective  prompts  [93]  could  provide
opportunities  for  externalization,  we  suggest  that  the
dialogical  aspects  of  externalization  in  social  situations
likely  may  them  an  even  more  interesting  case.  Studying
such  situations  may  provide  a  beneficial  means  of
understanding a phenomenon otherwise difficult to observe
directly [cf. 13,22,42].

The Dark Side of Reflection
With  rare  exception  [42,102],  the  papers  we  reviewed
treated reflection as almost universally beneficial. Whether
for  behavior  change  [91],  increased  self-awareness  [56],
improved  design  processes  [83],  or  better  educational
outcomes  [17],  reflection  was  nearly  always  positioned  as
wholly  good.  However,  some  research  has  suggested  that
such reflectiveness may bring with it associated, sometimes
unintended, costs.

First,  related  literature  on  reminiscence  [8,45]  and  privacy
[4]  has  at  times  described  the  value  of  forgetting.  Human
memory  naturally  and  selectively  fades  over  time,  in
contrast  with  the  eternally  perfect  recall  [cf. 55]  provided
by  many  computational  systems.  Such  perfect  recall,
though, can have negative repercussions. For example, one
of  the  functions  of  reminiscing  is bitterness  revival,  or

ReflectionDIS 2014, June 21–25, 2014, Vancouver, BC, Canada98continually focusing on negative life events and using them
to  justify  current  behavior  [99].While  the  pieces  we
reviewed  that  discussed  reminiscence  at  times  seemed  to
conflated it with reflection [e.g., 42,97], the authors of this
paper  suggest  the  two  as  distinct  processes.  Reminiscence
focuses on the recall of a specific event or events in one’s
past.  Reflection,  on  the  other  hand,  involves  synthesizing
across events to arrive at some greater understanding. While
the  two  are  almost  certainly  related,  it  might  be  beneficial
for  research  on  reminiscence  to  discuss  explicitly  the
perceived relationship with reflection.

Second,  computational  systems  by  their  nature  focus  on
things  they  can  observe  and  tend  to  omit  (intentionally  or
unintentionally)  those  things  not  easily  observable  or
measurable.  A  system  might  have  access  to,  say,  your
accuracy with a mouse pointer [44] but not your frustration
at  the  time  with  having  to  use  a  technology  you  may
already  dislike  [cf. 60].  Similarly,  as  described  above,  a
system can track a diabetic’s blood sugar levels [25] but has
a  difficult  time  representing  how  changes  in  use  of  the
system  may  enact  changes  in  performed  identity  or  self
presentation  [63].  We  do  not  suggest  that  such  “missing
factors”  should  be  included  and  tracked  in  the  design  of
reflective systems. Rather, we want to draw attention to the
potential commodification of experience [cf. 85] embedded
in  a  focus  on  automatically  observable,  quantifiable
metrics. Such a focus can not only unnecessarily constrain
the  kinds  of  reflective  activities  a  system  affords,  as  [87]
found  when  asking  people  to  reflect  on  their  friendships
using  their  Facebook  “See  Friendship”  pages,  but  it  also
may  have  significant  ramifications  on  the  impacts  that
reflection might have.

At  the  risk  meta-discussion,  it  might  be  valuable  for
designers  of  reflective  systems  to  explicate  the  supposed
value  of  reflection.  Such  an  endeavor  likely  resembles
reflective  design  [81],  critical  design  [5],  or  other
approaches  that involve  a  designer  interrogating  her or  his
own assumptions. Potential considerations include not only
the  good  of  reflection  but  also  the  kinds  of  sociocultural
practices in which reflection is embedded, as well as who is
presumed  to  be  in  a  position  privileged  enough  to  reflect
and, conversely, who is not.

CONCLUSION
While  the  literature  on  reflection  and  reflective  thought  is
decades  old  [e.g., 20], reflection has only recently come to
focus  in  HCI.  While  the  oldest  paper  in  our  corpus  was
published in 2000, most papers in the review presented here
were  published  in  the  years  since  2009.  We  suggest  this
recency  as  evidence  of  increasing  interest  in  designing  for
reflection. Indeed, an increased interest in reflection aligns
closely  with  many  concerns  concomitant  with  third  wave
HCI [11,35]. As research progresses in this area, we believe
that  the  directions  described  in  our  discussion  section  will
be  helpful  in  shaping  research  trajectory.  Specifically,  we
reiterate three main implications here.

First,  relatively  few  papers  clearly  define  the  concept  of
reflection.  We  present  this  finding  less  as  a  critique  and
more  as  an  opportunity.  Rather  than  prescribing  one  or
another  framework,  we  suggest  that  work  in  interactive
systems design would benefit from engaging with the rich,
diverse  theoretical  literature  on  reflection  [e.g.,
10,20,47,67]. Doing so may help clarify some of the current
“fuzziness”  [23]  in  our  discourse  around  reflection  and
related concepts [cf. 54]. Engagement with these definitions
may also move reflective systems beyond simply presenting
the  user  with  data  to  develop  other  techniques  for
supporting reflection.

Second,  of  those  papers  that  involved  an  evaluation,  very
few  focused  specifically  on  reflection  itself.  Given  the
vague  or  at  times  nonexistent  definitions  of  reflection
provided,  this  finding  should  perhaps  not  come  as  a
surprise. Again, though, we offer this less as a critique and
more as an opportunity for future work to engage with how
(if at all) [88] we might best assess or evaluate reflection.

Finally, we identified three main types of benefits reflection
was described to provide: better education, improved design
processes, and increased self knowledge. Future work could
make  valuable  contributions  by  exploring  situations  in
which  reflection  may  be  detrimental  or  even  harmful.
Furthermore,  the  techniques  used  to  encourage  reflection
across these and other areas evidence implicit assumptions,
particularly  that  feedback  constitutes  reflection.  To
reiterate, we suggest that engaging with the conceptual and
theoretical  literature  may  provide  valuable  grounding  and
inspiration  for  more  sophisticated,  subtle,  or  nuanced
designs for reflection.
