ABSTRACT
Activity tracking apps often make use of goals as one of their
core motivational tools. There are two critical components to this
tool: setting a goal, and subsequently achieving that goal. Despite
its crucial role in how a number of prominent self-tracking apps
function, there has been relatively little investigation of the goal-
setting and achievement aspects of self-tracking apps.

Here we explore this issue, investigating a particular goal setting
and achievement process that is extensive, recorded, and crucial for
both the app and its users’ success: weight loss goals in MyFitness-
Pal. We present a large-scale study of 1.4 million users and weight
loss goals, allowing for an unprecedented detailed view of how
people set and achieve their goals. We find that, even for difficult
long-term goals, behavior within the first 7 days predicts those who
ultimately achieve their goals, that is, those who lose at least as
much weight as they set out to, and those who do not. For instance,
high amounts of early weight loss, which some researchers have
classified as unsustainable, leads to higher goal achievement rates.
We also show that early food intake, self-monitoring motivation,
and attitude towards the goal are important factors. We then show
that we can use our findings to predict goal achievement with an
accuracy of 79% ROC AUC just 7 days after a goal is set. Finally,
we discuss how our findings could inform steps to improve goal
achievement in self-tracking apps.

1 INTRODUCTION
The purpose of an activity tracking app is to help users better
understand their behavior. Health-focused apps and fitness devices
are the most prevalent, often tracking activities like exercise, eating,
and heart rate. Beyond physical health, other types of behaviors
are becoming increasingly popular to track as well; for instance,
iPhones now come pre-installed with an app that tracks screen time
spent in other apps.

In many cases, users wish not only to observe their behavior,
but also to improve it [20, 43]. Activity tracking apps often aim to

help their users do this, and the guidance they provide can take
many forms, ranging from general advice and tips from experts, peer
pressure from social networking features, reminders or notifications
that ask the user to take a specific timely action, and enforcement of
explicitly articulated goals [44]. We think of all these mechanisms as
methods to promote behavioral change [4]. They play an important
role in people’s well-being, akin to the many methods for behavior
change in the offline world that one is familiar with, which might
include requests or demands from loved ones, medical professionals,
bosses, or in the most extreme cases, governmental intervention
via fines and criminal punishment.

A nearly universal feature in activity tracking apps, goals are one
of the most popular and effective methods for behavioral change
[31, 45]. They take many forms. For instance, Apple Watch has
three “rings” for the user to fill in, each representing a different daily
behavioral goal: one for standing 12 times, one for total calories
burned (set by the user), and one for 30 minutes of exercise. Other
apps have focused on moderating digital behaviors by setting goals
for the amount of time spent on social networking sites [2]. Perhaps
the most well-known goal is walking 10,000 steps per day assigned
by many fitness-focused activity trackers [7].

Goals in activity tracking apps involve both the setting of a goal
(the selection of a desired outcome) and also the achievement of
that goal (the process of working towards the selected outcome).
Setting a good goal is critically important for users’ success: too
hard, and the user will become frustrated and give up. Too easy, and
they won’t achieve as much health benefit as they could have [46].
There has been interesting recent work on goals in activity tracking
apps [5, 13, 25, 29, 36, 40, 48], but it remains a topic where there is
still much to be understood – particularly on the issue of setting
a good goal, since it can be difficult to find records of the process
by which goals are both set and subsequently achieved, along with
the behaviors that led to those goals being achieved. This has led
to the problem that, despite the importance of goal-setting and
achievement in activity tracking apps, users often receive limited
guidance on selecting a goal that they will actually meet. While
most activity trackers use general guidelines from relevant domain
expertise combined with demographic information [10] to help
users make a choice, after the initial goal is set they often provide
limited on-going advice as to whether that goal choice is turning
out to have been a good one. Some work has gone further and used
current trajectory towards a goal to intervene. For instance, they
can notify a user if they are not on track to meet their goal by a
certain time frame if they keep that trajectory, or are consistently
not meeting daily goals [1, 12, 22, 34, 38]. However, these methods
do not consider a holistic view of the many important behaviors
that lead to a goal being met, and make simplistic assumptions
about linear progressions.

571Present Work: Weight Loss Goals in MyFitnessPal. In this pa-
per we consider the goal-setting aspects of activity tracking apps
by focusing on a setting where detailed information on both how
goals are selected and many related behaviors while attempting to
achieve those goals can be studied. Our setting is the process of
selecting and working towards weight loss goals in MyFitnessPal.
This process has a clearly defined structure: first, upon creating
a MyFitnessPal account, all users select weight loss goals, and do
so without any guidance from the app. Users optionally provide a
free-text reason for their selection of that goal. Users then may then
use the app to log their food intake and weight to help them track
their progress towards that goal. Meeting their weight loss goal is
important for their health: achieving a self-determined weight goal
has been linked to long-term weight loss, while the failure to reach
a self-determined weight may discourage someone’s belief in their
ability to control their weight, resulting in abandonment of weight
loss behaviors and weight re-gain [14, 27].

MyFitnessPal weight loss goals thus have the key ingredients
we need: they take place in a goal-setting and achievement process
carried out by users of a activity tracking app who are working
towards meeting that goal, users use the app to help guide their
lower-level behaviors that will help them to meet that goal, and
given the nature of activity tracking, all of this is logged, making the
analysis possible. It also serves as an instance of a broader type of
goal-setting, familiar from the off-line world as well as the on-line
world, in which people aim to lose weight by setting a weight loss
goal.

Both the process of goal-setting and the process of losing weight
has been studied extensively in medical literature [14]. By contrast,
because of our interest in the issue of goal-setting and achievement
in activity tracking apps, we study the process from the perspective
of early detection of goals that will never be met: we ask which
goals users set, how users behave shortly after they set them, and
how those behaviors lead to those goals being achieved. Because
we are interested in exploring how activity tracking apps may
be able to help users select better goals, we focus specifically on
behavior that takes place during the first 7 days after a goal is set,
and examine whether we might be able to detect early-on that a
long-term weight loss goal will never be met. Such early-detection
would enable an intervention warning a user that they are working
towards a goal they are unlikely to meet, which means we may be
able to encourage them to re-think a more realistic goal and prevent
them from spending too much time working towards and becoming
invested in that goal, only to ultimately become discouraged and
re-gain weight because they did not meet it. This could potentially
be considered a “just-in-time intervention” [33].

Present work: Main Results. We analyze 2.8 million weight loss
goals with 44.6 million weights logged over a period of three years.
We begin by validating our dataset through a comparison of the
goals the people set in MyFitnessPal to prior studies from before
the age of activity trackers, finding that women set more ambitious
goals than men and younger adults set more ambitious goals than
older adults (Section 4). We also use the unprecedented size of
our dataset to show that some findings in prior work are likely
due to selection effects. We then analyze goal completion rates
and duration, finding that men and older adults are more likely to

meet their goals (even when accounting for goal difficulty), but that
overall completion rates are low (Section 5).

We then turn to the problem of early detection of goals that will
never be met (Section 6). We investigate user’s behavior over the
first seven days after they set their goal. We find that, contrary
to what some prior clinical studies might suggest, there’s no such
thing as “too much” early weight loss when it comes to meeting
your goal (Section 6.1), and that people who log their weight more
frequently within the first week are more likely to meet their goals
(Section 6.2). We show that more calories reported per day during
the first 7 days leads to a lower likelihood of meeting goals, but only
for users who are committed loggers; surprisingly, for many users,
logging more calories actually indicates a higher propensity to meet
a weight loss goal (Section 6.3). We then turn to the motivations
behind the goals that people set, introducing a novel application of
topic modeling algorithms to identify four primary motivators and
show how achievement rates vary with these motivators (Section
6.4).

Finally, we show that whether a user will achieve their target
weight can be predicted just based on the initial behavior during
the first few days after the target is set. We build a machine learning
model to predict target achievement with promising accuracy. We
conclude with a discussion of how these results can be translated
into actionable suggestions for activity tracking apps as well as
traditional offline weight loss programs.

2 RELATED WORK

Goal-setting Theory and Weight Loss. There is a vast body of
work discussing the mechanics and psychological aspects of goals,
as well as how goals can be used for health-related behaviors. Locke
and Latham’s seminal work summarizes empirical research on goal-
setting theory [27]. Other researchers have focused on how those
findings apply specifically to health goals [19, 46].

As with goal-setting theory, there is also a vast body of work
discussing the mechanics of weight loss and weight loss goals. As
weight loss goals tend to focus on longer term weight loss (as dis-
cussed later, we find most people want to lose significant percent
of their body weight), literature relating to longer-term weight
loss and maintenance, such as Elfhag and Rossner conceptual re-
view of the subject, is most relevant to our work [14]. Other work
has focused on characterizing weight loss goals, both in terms of
what goals people set and which goals are associated with the best
outcomes [16, 24, 26, 27, 49].

Our work first verifies that findings from these smaller-scale
offline studies generally apply to our activity tracking dataset in
terms of which goals people choose to set and their likelihood of
meeting them, while also using the unprecedented scale of our
dataset to present new insights. We then extend existing work by
specifically investigating early behaviors that predict whether or
not a user will meet their weight loss goal in an activity tracking
app.

Implementing Goals in Activity Trackers. Activity trackers
provide users with an environment to both set goals and track
their progress towards their goals. In the best case, they might
also be described as systems to help people implement their goals
[18]. Some work has looked at different higher-level strategies for

572implementing goals in self-trackers, typically through qualitative
small-scale studies [8, 11, 32]. Other work has investigated the role
that goals play in changing behavior in self-trackers [9, 15, 15, 35].
Rather than exploring the best way to implement goals in activity
trackers, our work is a case study of one of the world’s most popular
implementations: MyFitnessPal.

Adaptive Goals. While goals in self-trackers frequently take into
account one’s current size and weight, personalized or adaptive
goals that take behavior in to account are used sparsely in practice
[37]. Some researchers have sought to assign adaptive fitness goals
based on a particular user’s historical data, in order to improve a
goal that is too difficult or too easy. These typically employ simple
algorithms that raise goals that the user is easily achieving, and
lower goals that the user is struggling to achieve [1, 12, 22, 34, 38].
MyBehavior, in a study of 17 users, suggested exercise or actions to
take, but not goals [42]. Hermanny et al. explored using heart rate
variability to set goals [21]. These adaptive goals can be considered
part of a new class of “just-in-time interventions” [33].

Critically, existing work has focused on measuring progress
directly related to the goal (e.g. steps for step count goals, calories
for calorie goals). Our work builds on a large dataset covering many
behaviors related to achieving the goal and findings from work in
goal-setting theory to understand whether a goal will be met by
taking a holistic view of a user’s behavior. We are aware of one
other paper which aimed to predict whether a weight loss goal will
be met; however their model relied upon users having already been
working towards their goal for at least two months and to have
logged a large number of weights, meaning it was only applicable
to less than 1% of the total number of users in their dataset [47].

3 DATASET DESCRIPTION
This section describes the mechanics of the activity tracking app
MyFitnessPal, the dataset used in this paper.

The Mechanics of MyFitnessPal. MyFitnessPal enables its users
to track many health-related behaviors. Users can log their food
intake, their exercise, and their weight. Users can also set health
and behavioral goals. There are three main goals in the app: total
weight loss, weekly weight loss, and calories per day. In this paper,
we focus on the total weight loss goal: the weight that the user
would like to achieve. All users enter a total weight loss goal upon
creating a MyFitnessPal account. The app does not provide any
guidance when a user is selecting their total weight loss goal. Users
also decide upon a weekly weight loss goal between 0 and 2 lbs
per week, in increments of half a pound. The default value for
this field is 1 lb per week. Using this weekly weight loss goal and
demographic information entered by the user (such as current
weight and height), the app then automatically assigns the user a
calories per day limit. Each food that a user logs is counted against
this limit, while exercise is counted as burning off some of those
calories.

To log a food item, users type the name of what they ate into
the app’s search bar, which will then return a list of matches from
which the user can choose. Many of these items are branded and
will contain full nutritional content supplied by their manufacturer
(e.g. a McDonald’s Big Mac or Trader Joes Granola). Other generic
items, such as eggs or chicken breasts, will also contain nutritional

content. If the user does not find a suitable match in the app’s
database, they can optionally log their item manually and choose
which, if any, nutrient content to provide. There are two methods
for logging a weight. First, a user can manually enter their current
weight into the app whenever they would like. Second, users can
connect MyFitnessPal an many internet-connected “smart” scale,
which automatically transfer weights they record to the app.

Progress towards the calories per day limit is prominently dis-
played on the main page of the app. Users can easily view their
weight loss progress by clicking on a large icon in the bar at the
bottom of the screen.

The Dataset. We use a dataset of 1.4 million MyFitnessPal users
over three years, from August 2014 through April 2017. Users set
2.8 million goals, log 44.6 million weights, and eat 8.8 billion food
items. Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for our dataset.

In this paper, we focus on weight loss goals and ask the question
of which users will ultimately achieve their goal. A user’s goal is
considered achieved if, at some point in the future after setting the
goal, the user logs a weight that is at least as low as that goal. As
we are interested in users who showed at least some amount of
interest in using the app to track their weight loss progress, we
filter to users with at least 7 days between the first and last logged
weight of their goal. To remove any minors, extreme outliers, or
users who entered likely fake information, we also filter out users
who entered a weight over 1000 pounds, an age less than 18 or over
80, and who’s weight change goal was more than a 100% difference
from of their current weight. This removed 3, 681 users users.

4 WHAT WEIGHT GOALS DO PEOPLE

CHOOSE?

Performance towards a weight loss goal is, of course, significantly
dependant upon the goal’s difficulty. This section focuses on goal
selection. We aim to validate our dataset by comparing the weight
loss goals that users set in MyFitnessPal to the weight loss goals
that people set before the age of self-trackers. In particular, we
study which goals users choose for themselves; stratifying by demo-
graphic information. As mentioned earlier, MyFitnessPal provides
no guidance when users are selecting weight targets, which enables

tial weight. We see a somewhat skewed distribution (skewd-
ness of -0.46), with a peak around 10% weight loss.

an unbiased analysis. While we do note that there is likely a selec-
tion bias in terms of who chooses to use MyFitnessPal, towards
people who are interested in loosing weight, this bias towards users
interested in self-improvement is likely present in many activity
tracking apps.

4.1 Aiming Low: Initial Target Selection
We begin by plotting a histogram of weight loss goals, in terms of
percent of current weight, in Figure 1. We find a somewhat skewed
(skewedness = -0.46) distribution with a peak around 10% weight
loss. We also see that a non-trivial portion of users are actually
aiming to gain weight. We remove these users for our later analysis,
as this is outside the scope of this paper.

4.2 Declining Ambition: User Age
In this section, we ask how ambition changes with age. To answer
this question, we begin by plotting the amount of weight users aim
to lose (as a percent of current weight) by age. We find a U-shaped
curve, shown in Figure 2a. For instance, for women between the
ages of 18 to 35, users aim to lose an increasingly large percent
of their weight, moving from 13.2% to 15.7% loss (Mann-Whitney
U p < 0.001). The number then stays relatively constant around
15.7% up until the age of 60. However, after age 60, users aim to
lose an increasingly smaller amount of weight, with users at age
75 returning approximately to the same goal as those at age 18
(Mann-Whitney U p < 0.001).

To validate our results, we can compare them to a 1989 large-scale
telephone-based survey of weight loss goals [49]. To our knowledge,
this is the most recent such survey, though notably, it occurred
long before the existence of activity tracking apps. The survey
reports results from 21,109 American households, asking if they
were currently aiming to lose weight. If the survey participant
said yes, then the study included that goal in their results. This
means that both this survey and our behavioral tracking dataset
focus on users aiming to lose weight, thus removing the potential
for selection bias on that co-variate. The survey reports results
separately for men and women.

Similarly to our results, the survey found a U-shaped curve, but
with larger magnitudes. For women between ages 18-29, the survey
reports a mean of 17.3 percent loss, compared to our 14.3. Between

Figure 2: Weight loss goal as percent of current weight, by
age. (A): Without stratification by BMI. We find a U-shaped
curve in agreement with existing literature. The U is signifi-
cantly deeper for women than for men. (B): With this strat-
ification (results shown only for women), we now see that
younger adults set the most ambitious goals, but get less am-
bitious up until the age of 30, from which point goals stay
relatively consistent. Then, around 60, older adults set in-
creasingly less ambitious goals. Error bars in all plots corre-
spond to bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals (here, they
are mostly too small to be visible).

ages 40-49, the survey reports a mean of 18.1, compared to our
16.0. And between ages 70-79, the survey reports a mean of 14.9,
compared to our 13.4. The similar shape of their curve to ours
helped to validate our results, while at the same time showing that
at all ages, users in MyFitnessPal are slightly less ambitious than
those in the 1989 survey.

Having validated our dataset, we now ask, how can we explain
this U-shaped curve present in both our work and existing work?
The U-shape seems to go against what we might expect, given the
fact that younger people tend to be less conservative and take more
risks than older people [16]. We note that neither we nor the work
we validate our results against have thus far accounted for the fact
that age is strongly correlated with whether someone is at a healthy

574Figure 3: Women set more ambitious goals than men; when
controlling for BMI, women aim to lose approximately 5%
more weight.

weight, with younger adults more likely to be at a healthy weight.
We hypothesize that the U-shaped curve may be due to the fact that
younger users will be healthier on average than older users, and
thus simply need to lose less to reach a healthy weight. To test this,
we take advantage of the unprecedented size of our dataset and
stratify our earlier plot by BMI (Body Mass Index, a number based
on height and weight used to determine if someone is classified
as having a normal weight, overweight, or obese). We do so in
Figure 2b. We now find that, when accounting for how healthy a
user’s existing weight is, we see that younger users actually set
significantly more ambitious weight loss goals than older users.

4.3 Gender Matters: User Gender
We now turn to gender differences. Given our findings from the
previous section, In Figure 3 we again stratify by BMI to control
for selection bias, as men tend to have a higher BMI than women.
We find that women set more ambitious goals than men and that,
regardless of BMI, this effect size is about a difference of 5% (Mann-
Whitney U p =< 0.0001). This is somewhat in agreement with the
1989 survey mentioned above, but with a larger magnitude (they
saw a difference of at most 4.1%).

5 DO PEOPLE REACH THEIR GOALS?
Next, we explore goal achievement rates along with the amount
of time taken for goal achievement. We find that overall, 18.2% of
weight loss goals are met. This is remarkably close to an earlier
finding from 2005 that approximately 20% of people overweight
individuals are successful at long-term weight loss [50].

5.1 How many people reach their goals?
Clearly, goal difficulty should impact goal achievement. We hy-
pothesize that more difficult goals are less likely to be achieved.
Therefore, we start by breaking down target achievement as a func-
tion of goal size. Figure 4 shows a cumulative distribution function
(CDF) with a different line for target size buckets. The x-axis indi-
cates percentage of target reached (x = 100 indicates that a target
has been achieved). We find that target achievement is relatively
low, and decreases as targets become more ambitious. People with
the easiest goals (between 1 and 2 percent of their initial weight)
are most likely to achieve their targets, with nearly 30% of these

Figure 4: CDF of goal achievement, stratified by goal diffi-
culty. X -axis indicates percent of goal achieved while y-axis
indicates the portion of users who have achieved at least that
amount of their goal. We find that across the board, goals
are unlikely to be achieved. Only 30% of the easiest goals are
ever reached, while less than 5% of the most difficult goals
are ever reached.

users reaching at least 100% of their initial weight loss goal. Of
users with the most difficult goals (between 40 and 60 percent of
their initial weight), only 10% are likely to achieve their target.

The x-axis of the above plot begins at zero, indicating that a
user’s weight has not changed. We note that the plotted y-value of
our CDF does not begin at 1.0 for any of the goals; this is because
a large portion of users end up gaining weight, putting their goal
achievement progress to the left of our x-axis starting point. Inter-
estingly, despite that fact that users who set easier goals are more
likely to achieve them, we also find that users who set easier goals
are more likely to go in the opposite direction and gain weight. For
instance we see that only 40% of users with the easiest goals lose
weight, while 90% of users with the hardest goals end up losing
weight. This finding highlights the importance of not setting a goal
that is “too easy” for a user.

We also notice a blip at 100 percent achievement, indicating that
while many users either change their target or stop using the app
once they’ve reached their goal, others continue to lose weight
even after achieving their target.

We also find that men are more likely to meet their weight loss
goals, even when accounting for the fact that men set easier goals:
for instance, men who aim to lose 5-10% of their weight succeed
28% of the time, while women who aim to lose 5-10% of their weight
succeed 20% of the time.

5.2 How long does it take to reach your target?
Having established how many people reach their targets, we now
ask how long it takes them to do so. In Figure 5, we show a CCDF
of time taken to achieve a goal as function of goal difficulty. We
find that more difficult goals take longer to achieve. For the easiest
goals, half of all users who meet their goal do so within 100 days.
For the most difficult goals, this number is closer to 300 days.

575Figure 5: CCDF of days taken to achieve a goal, stratified
by goal difficulty. More difficult goals take more time to
achieve.

6 EARLY WARNING SIGNS
Having seen that few users ever meet their goals, we now ask
what are the early behavioral factors that indicate a user will or
won’t meet their goal? We ground our analysis in the existing
body of literature on short and long term weight loss. We work to
both answer open questions in the literature and to determine how
existing findings apply specifically to early detection in weight loss
target achievement.

We focus specifically on the first seven days after the first weight
of a goal has been logged. We find that even for difficult, long-term
goals such as losing twenty pounds, behavioral differences observed
during just the first seven days are indicative of large changes – up
to double – the propensity to reach that goal.

6.1 Initial Weight Loss Patterns

Too much too fast?. Initial weight loss has been identified as a
predictor for later weight loss, and also for weight loss maintenance
[14]. Some studies have found that the greater the initial weight
loss, the better the subsequent outcome [3]. However, other work
has found that greater initial weight loss actually predicts future
weight gain, explained by the fact that overly quick weight loss is
considered unsustainable and clinically unhealthy [30].

Goal-setting theory suggests that early progress towards a goal
could serve to provide future motivation, while slow initial progress
may cause frustration and ultimately lead to an abandonment of the
goal [28]. This taken together with the clinical findings discussed
above, make it uncertain as to whether there may be such a thing
as “too much” initial progress towards a weight loss goal.

To answer this question, first plot propensity to meet weight
loss goal by weight change over the first seven days. Figure 6a
shows that we find a U-shaped curve suggested by prior weight
loss maintenance literature. On the right, we see that as people
gain more weight during the first week, that are less likely to meet
their weight loss goals. On the left we see that, as people lose more
weight, they are also less likely to meet their goals. We note that
the downward trend seems to start around -2 lbs per week, which
is exactly what prior literature would suggested: 2 lbs per week of
weight loss is often considered the maximum healthy amount [23].

(a)

(b)

Figure 6: Propensity to meet weight loss goal by weight loss
over the first week. (A): Without stratification by goal dif-
ficulty, we find a U-shaped curve in agreement with exist-
ing literature suggesting that “too much” early weight loss is
unsustainable and leads to worse longer-term outcomes. (B):
With stratification by goal difficulty, we now see that people
who lose more weight in the first week are far more likely to
reach their goals. Contrary to what medical literature might
suggest, there is no such thing as “too much” unsustainable
early weight loss which ultimately leads to worse results.

However, we hypothesize that there may be a different reason
for this U-shape curve than the idea that “too much” early weight
loss is unsustainable and leads to weight gains, as suggested by
prior literature. We hypothesize that this U-shaped curve may be
due to the fact that people who lose less weight during the first
week have also set easier goals on average. To test this, we can
stratify our earlier chart by goal difficulty. We show this result in
Figure 6b. We now find that there is in fact no amount of initial
weight loss which reduces a user’s propensity to meet their weight
loss goal. Further, see a large difference in propensity to meet goals
based on initial weight loss: for instance, a user who loses between
4-5 pounds over the first two weeks of their 20-40 pound loss goal
is twice as likely meet that goal as one who loses between 1 and 2
pounds (Mann-Whitney U p < 0.001). This finding suggests that
follow-up studies to highly cited clinical weight loss papers may
be warranted, to determine whether the idea of “too much early
weight loss” is due to confounding by motivational reasons rather
than physical limitations around unsustainable weight loss

Figure 8 shows propensity to meet a weight loss goal by mean
calories per day over the first 7 days, normalized by each user’s
Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR, the amount of calories an individual
consumes per day at rest), for both committed and uncommitted
food loggers. To avoid confounding by goal difficulty, each chart
contains only a specific range of goal weight losses. We find that,
regardless of amount calories logged, committed food loggers are
far more likely to meet their weight loss goals. We also see that, as
committed loggers log more calories, they are less likely to meet
their goals, which is what we would expect given that eating more
calories results in worse weight loss. However, this effect only lasts
up until around 110% BMR calories logged, after which more calo-
ries logged actually seems to correspond with a higher propensity
to meet the goal (though we note that confidence intervals all over-
lap). This is likely explained by the fact that some of these users
are not actually eating more, but rather are extreme loggers who
log all food that they eat.

For uncommitted loggers, we see a very slight curve for which
more eating indicates a lower propensity to meet a goal, followed
by a higher propensity. The difference between the top of the curve
and the bottom of the curve is extremely small, which is likely
because for these uncommitted loggers, more food loggers mostly is
indicative of an increasingly higher commitment to logging, rather
than more eating. Overall, we find that logging more calories leads
to the expected reduction in propensity to meet a weight loss goal,
but only for committed food loggers.

6.4 Motivation
When a user sets their target, MyFitnessPal optionally allowed
users to fill in a free text form which asked why they were selecting
their goal. We call this a “weight loss reason”. Attitude has been
found to be important in weight loss maintenance [14], which
suggests it may also be important in meeting weight loss goals. We
hypothesize that the weight loss reason provided by a user may
provide a glimpse into their mindset and attitude towards setting
and meeting their goal. In this section, we examine these weight
loss reasons to determine whether they are indicative of propensity
to meet a weight loss goal.

Figure 7: Propensity to achieve goal by number of days
logged a weight over the first seven days, stratified by goal
difficulty. We see that across all difficulty of goals, people
who log weights more frequently over the first week are
more likely to achieve their goal.

6.2 Self-monitoring
Self-monitoring means observing oneself and one’s behaviour. In-
deed, this is the core purpose of an activity tracker. Most activity
tracking apps today rely on their users manually choosing log
many important behaviors. While step count is typically logged
automatically, workouts, food intake, and weights often involve
some amount of manual input.

Regular self-monitoring of weight has been linked to long-term
weight loss maintenance, which suggests that it may also be im-
portant for meeting weight loss goals [6]. In Figure 7, we plot the
number of days that a user logged their weight over the first 7 days
of a goal. We see that, for all difficulty of weight goals, people who
log more regularly over the first seven days are significantly more
likely to ultimately meet their goal. For a goal between 40-80 lbs,
users who log a weight all 7 days of their first week are more than
twice as likely to ultimately meet their goal than those who log
only once, moving from 10% to 20% likelihood (Mann-Whitney U
p < 0.001). Similarly, for a goal between 10 and 20 lbs, we see a
change between logging one weight and seven weights from 15%
up to 35% (Mann-Whitney U p < 0.001).

6.3 Dietary Intake
One of the core features of MyFitnessPal is the ability to log food
intake. Obviously, food intake is strongly associated with weight
loss. Longer-term weight loss and maintenance has been linked to
eating smaller portions and higher quality nutrients [14].

In MyFitnessPal, users log individual food items, where each
item has an associated calorie amount (typically populated by My-
FitnessPal’s food database). We hypothesize that users might fall
into two categories: uncommitted loggers, who likely aren’t par-
ticularly motivated to log their food and don’t log everything they
eat, and committed loggers, who are motivated to log what they
eat. We assign users to groups based on total days logged over the
first 7 days: users who logged at least one food item all 7 days are
considered a committed logger, and users who did not are consid-
ered an uncommitted logger. How likely are these groups to meet
their weight loss goals?

577(a) 5-10 lb goal loss.

(b) 10-20 lb goal loss.

(c) 20-40 lb goal loss.

Figure 8: Committed food loggers during the first 7 days of a goal are much more likely to meet their weight loss goals than less
committed loggers. Further, committed loggers who log more calories are less likely to meet their goal, while uncommitted
loggers who log more calories are more likely to meet their goal.

and, as we showed earlier, more difficult goals are less likely to be
met.

We now ask: what is different about the reasons given by people
who meet their goals versus the people who don’t? We first find that
people who meet their goals use 1.4 fewer words (Mann Whitney
U p < 0.0001) than those who do meet their goals, at 19.2 words
compared to 20.6 words. This is surprising, as one might expect
that a longer reason indicates more commitment to the app or more
thought-out reasons for losing weight. But how do these reasons
differ in terms of the content’s subject matter?

Topic Models. Studies have found that people who are motivated
to lose weight by a desire for greater self-confidence or superficial
considerations such as appearance (e.g. a “healthy narcissism”)
are more successful at maintaining weight loss than those who
are primarily motivated by medical concerns or from pressure by
those around them [14]. To determine if we see a similar effect in
propensity to meet weight loss goals, we would like to map each
weight loss reason to an easily interpretable category. To do this,
we propose a novel application of topic modeling algorithms.

Topic models are an unsupervised learning approach to auto-
matically infer interesting patterns in large text corpora [39]. We
use this exploratory approach with the goal of understanding what
topics are commonly discussed in goal reasons provided by users,
with the aim of understanding how they differ in goals which are
or are not achieved. Topic modeling has previously been used to
extract health-related topics from Twitter [17, 39].

We build our topic model using non-negative matrix factorization
(NMF) on extracted term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-
idf) features from our corpus, which helps to select the most useful
terms. We use the “English” stopwords list from scikit-learn [41]
along with a few words we added manually: want, look, feel, better,
healthy, healthier. We use these as stopwords because they were
present in far too many articles, to the point that they dominated
every topic generated, and in this situation a typical approach to
improve topic models is to remove such words. We experiment
with selecting a number of topics between k=3 and 20, ultimately
selecting k=4 after finding them the most clearly interpretable and
differentiated.

Figure 9: Propensity to achieve goal by motivation. Motiva-
tions derived from learning a topic model over free-text goal
reasons provided by users and then assigning each goal a pri-
mary topic.

After filtering to users who choose to use this field, we end up
with 56,014 goals associated with a reason. We first provide a few
sample reasons to give a sense of the type of reasons provided
by MyFitnessPal users (note that for anonymization, we slightly
change the exact text while retaining the meaning). Many are some-
what generic, with users writing that they are setting their goal “To
feel better, and have more energy!” and “I would like to get in shape
and get back to the weight where I felt comfortable with my body.”
However, some reasons were quite specific to the user’s personal
situation, such as “My dad’s adopted and doesn’t know his family
history, but he had a heart attack at age 34 and a RI before age 46.
I already have heart issues (which admittedly are well controlled
with meds, but still.....”

The choice to fill in this field seems likely to be related to propen-
sity to self monitor and commitment to the app which, as discussed
earlier, are linked to a higher propensity to achieve one’s goal. Sur-
prisingly, we find that users who fill in a weight loss reason are
less likely to meet their goals (20.5% vs 17.6%) (Mann-Whitney U
p < 0.001). However, this difference can likely be explained by the
fact that people who supply a weight loss reason aim to lose nearly
50% more weight (33.8 lbs vs 24.6 lbs, Mann-Whitney U p < 0.001)

578Table 2 presents the top 10 terms from each of the four discovered
topics, along with our manually assigned topic labels. We assign
each goal reason a “primary topic” by selecting the topic with the
highest associated score from our NMF model, with a minimum
required score of 0.01 (22.4% of goals did not meet this threshold
for any of the four topics). We find the topics to be:

(1) Role model for kids: users with a reason in this topic dis-
cussed how they wished to set a better example for their
children. Primary topic for 12.4% of users.

(2) Lifestyle: users wanted to live longer, happier lives so that
they’d have more time to spend with their family. Primary
topic for 12.8% of users.

(3) Health: users were concerned about their health and wanted
to get in better shape. Primary topic for 36.9% of users.
(4) Clothes: reasons in this topic discussed wanting to fit into
older clothes that they used to be able to fit in to, or being able
purchase and fit into new clothes that they found attractive.
Primary topic for 15.4% of users.

Now that we have learned topics for our goal reasons, we can
examine which reasons reflect a higher propensity to meet one’s
goal. To do this. In Figure 9, we plot propensity to meet goals by
primary topic. We first note that, unlike in prior sections of this
paper, we are unable to stratify by goal difficulty due to the smaller
size of this dataset. This means that some results may be explained
by the fact that, for instance, people who’s primary motivation is
fitting in to clothes set slightly easier goals ( 2 lbs) than those who
primary motivation is health. That said, we do find that people
primarily motivated by health are more likely to meet their goals
than people primarily motivated by clothing, which seemingly goes
against what the prior work cited above would suggest.

7 PREDICTING GOAL ACHIEVEMENT
Next, we build on insights from previous sections to predict the
likelihood that a user will ever achieve their goal after observing
their behavior over the first 7 days.

7.1 Features Used For Learning
To illustrate the predictive power of the different feature sets re-
ported earlier in this paper, we define a series of models, each with
a different feature set corresponding to one of the goal-related
behaviors. We focus on six types of features:

(1) Weight loss goal: In Section 4, we saw propensity to meet
a weight loss goal varied significantly with the difficulty of
the goal, with easier goals more likely to be met.

(2) Demographics: we found that propensity to meet a goal
also varied with the user’s age and gender, with men and
younger adults more likely to meet their goals.

(3) Initial weight loss: In Section 5.1, we saw that people who
lost more weight over the first 7 days were more likely to
meet their goal.

(4) Self-monitoring: In Section 5.2, we saw that users who log
their weights more frequently over the first 7 days are more
likely to meet their goals.

(5) Calories logged and frequency of logging: In Section
5.3, we saw that logging more calories indicates a lower
likelihood of meeting a goal, but only for committed loggers.

(6) Motivation: In Section 5.4, we analyzed free-text motivation
provided by users. We use word-level TF-IDF results (for the
top 5000 words) as features in this model. This is the same
methodology used to train our topic models discussed in
Section 5.4.

7.2 Experimental Setup
We aim to predict the likelihood that a user will ever achieve their
weight loss goal, after observing their behavior only in the first 7
days. As in Section 6, we filter to users for who there is at least 7
days between the start of their goal and the last weight logged of
their goal (though we do not require a minimum number of weight
logged during this period). We also remove all users who have
already met their goal within the first several days, as it would not
be a fair task to predict goal achievement after a user has already
achieved their goal. We note that, as shown in Figure 6, most users
take far longer than 7 days to meet their goals. We also remove
users who didn’t last at least 7 days to avoid users who download
the app as a curiosity and use it very briefly without ever truly
attempting to meet their goal. Further, we filter to users who use
the features of the app that we discuss in this paper at least once:
specifically, users must log at least one food item, and also must
fill in the free-text motivation field when setting their goal. After
applying these filters, we arrive at a dataset containing 33,642 goals.
(This large reduction from our overall dataset is primarily due to
the fact that most users chose not to provide a free-text weight
loss reason, as the app provided no motivation for them to do
so. Without that restriction, we would have over 900,000 goals in
our prediction dataset, and we find that ROC AUC would be only
slightly reduced).

We experiment with several classification models, including Lin-
ear Regression, Gradient Boosted Trees, Support Vector Machines,
and Random Forests. We find that Random Forest models are the
most effective for our task, and so we report results from only from
those models. Because of the unbalanced dataset (only 18.6% of
users achieve their goal) and the trade-off between true and false
positive rate associated with prediction, we choose to compare mod-
els using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve (AUC) which is equal to the probability that a classifier will
rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly
chosen negative one. Thus, a random baseline will score 50% on
ROC AUC. We use a 10-fold cross-validation for estimation. We
standardize all features to have zero mean and unit variance.

7.3 Results
Figure 10 shows the prediction accuracy of our models. With a
model trained on all available features, we achieve a an accuracy
of 79% ROC AUC.

We find the most predictive features to be the initial goal and
the user’s motivation. Strikingly, motivation is significantly more
predictive than eating patterns. We note that our motivation model
was trained with a simple TF-IDF analysis of the words a user
writes in their short free-text goal justification. Future work should
explore more sophisticated models and more deeply analyze how
free-text motivation for a goal can predict goal achievement rates.
Surprisingly, we see that initial weight loss on its own was not

579Implications And Future Work. In addition to uncovering im-
portant factors in how people set and achieve their weight loss
goals in an activity tracking app, our work also suggests several
practical implications. Our work shows that it is possible to predict
whether a user will achieve their weight loss goals after observing
just their first week of behavior while attempting to meet that goal.
This opens the door for activity tracking apps to build a new type
of intervention which notifies a user that they seem unlikely to
meet their long term goal. Such an intervention might enable users
to decide that they should set an easier goal, before they become
frustrated and drop out of the app.

Future work should consider several important directions to de-
termine both how to create such an intervention and to determine
the effectiveness of such an intervention. First, work should investi-
gate what a activity tracking app do when it recognizes that a goal
will never be met, and how users respond to potential interventions.
For instance, it is possible than if the user is told too forcefully that
they will never meet their goal, perhaps they’ll just immediately
give up without aiming for an easier goal. On the other hand, if a
user is simply assigned an easier goal, it is possible that they will
internally still be interested in meeting their first goal, and thus do
not truly have an easier one.

9 CONCLUSION
We present a quantitative analysis of the weight loss goals that
people set in MyFitnessPal, and the early behaviors that lead to the
achievement of those goals. We find that women set more ambi-
tious goals than men, and that younger users set more ambitious
goals than older users. We find that most of these goals are never
achieved, but that easier goals are far more likely to be achieved
than harder ones. We then show that propensity to meet a goal
varies significantly by behavior observed during the first week af-
ter setting the goal, despite the fact that goals often take months
or even years to achieve. We find that, contrary to what findings
from medical studies on weight-loss maintenance might suggest,
there is no amount of early weight loss which is “too much”; rather
more early progress towards a goal predicts a higher propensity to
achieve that goal. We also find that people who log more calories
are less likely to meet their goal, but only when we account for
commitment to logging. We introduce a novel application of topic
modeling to show the four primary motivations that users have for
selecting their goals. Finally, we show that the results presented in
our paper are sufficiently strong to predict, after observing seven
days of behavior, whether a user will ultimately meet their goal,
with an accuracy of up to 79% ROC AUC. Our findings suggest that
activity tracking apps may be able to help their users avoid the
pitfalls of failing to meet their goals by asking them them select
a more realistic goal after observing their holistic behavior and
motivations early-on.

8 DISCUSSION
Goals are a critical component of activity tracking apps. However,
long-term goals such as weight loss are rarely met. This paper
moves towards addressing this challenge by analyzing user behavior
related to both setting and achieving their goals. In particular, we
focus on how behavior during the first week after setting a goal
predicts whether or not that goal will be achieved. We do so because
early detection and notification of goals that are too hard may
enable a new class of interventions where users can be encouraged
make their goals easier before becoming frustrated and leaving the
app. We identify a set of factors which predict goal achievement
related to demographics, initial weight loss, self-monitoring, dietary
intake, and motivation, summarized in Section 1.

Limitations. There are several important limitations to our work,
primarily related to generalizability and causality. First, we note
that a weight loss goal is a long-term health goal, which we saw
typically takes weeks, months, or even years to achieve. It is an open
question as to whether the characteristics of users who achieve
short-term goals, such as “walk 10 minutes today”, might differ.

We also note that our results are correlational in nature. Ideally,
the factors we analyze would represent causal effects to help us
understand how to improve weight loss goal achievement. While in
our analysis we both build off of prior causal findings and make ef-
forts to reduce potential confounders, the factors that lead to weight
loss are enormously complex and causal analysis is often extremely
difficult or impossible. However, this is not a necessary requirement
for such factors to be useful in machine learning models that predict
whether or not a goal is likely to be met. We show that even simple
models can predict goal achievement after observing just one week
of behavior with reasonably high accuracy.
