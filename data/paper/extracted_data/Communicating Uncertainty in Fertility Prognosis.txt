ABSTRACT
Communicating uncertainty has been shown to provide pos-
itive effects on user understanding and decision-making.
Surprisingly however, most personal health tracking appli-
cations fail to disclose the accuracy of their measurements
and predictions. In the case of fertility tracking applications
(FTAs), inaccurate predictions have already led to numerous
unwanted pregnancies and law suits. However, integrating
uncertainty into FTAs is challenging: Prediction accuracy
is hard to understand and communicate, and its effect on
users’ trust and behavior is not well understood. We created
a prototype for uncertainty visualizations for FTAs and eval-
uated it in a four-week field study with real users and their
own data (N=9). Our results uncover far-reaching effects of
communicating uncertainty: For example, users interpreted
prediction accuracy as a proxy for their cycle health and as
a security indicator for contraception. Displaying predicted
and detected fertile phases next to each other helped users to
understand uncertainty without negative emotional effects.

1 INTRODUCTION
During the last years, many new FTAs have entered the mar-
ket and gained significant popularity, for example Glow1,
Clue2, and Natural Cycles3 [10, 14]. At the same time, the use
of exactly such applications has led to numerous unwanted
pregnancies and law suits. By now, both researchers [3, 9, 34]
and public press are voicing their concerns4. On the posi-
tive side, FTAs might be a more effective contraceptive than
traditional fertility-awareness-based methods [2] allowing
more women to prevent (or seek) pregnancies without tak-
ing medication (mainly to avoid side effects) and to learn
about their body [10, 14]. Previous research in both digi-
tal health [3, 14, 34] and HCI [10] has highlighted the im-
portance of communicating the (limited) accuracy of FTA
predictions, which depends on various factors, such as the
amount of data, cycle stability and consistency of lifestyle.
However, none of the applications that we reviewed for this
paper seems to communicate prediction accuracy beyond a
general statement, e.g., on their websites. Communicating
individually calculated accuracy poses several challenges:
Prediction algorithms and accuracy can be hard to under-
stand and communicate and – as the subject of female cycles
and fertility is emotionally charged – they might trigger
hopes and concern of varying nature. This paper explores
these challenges.

The benefits of communicating uncertainty have been well
demonstrated in HCI [16, 17, 22] and beyond (see, e.g., [1, 11,
15]). However, uncertainty visualizations in research were
rarely tested in the wild with real user data (with the notable
exception of work by Shaer et al. [35]). Our work therefore

expands research on uncertainty visualization with rich ac-
counts of users’ perceptions and emotions when interacting
with personal uncertainty visualizations in their daily lives.
The contributions of this paper are threefold:

(1) We present a prototype for displaying fertility data

including uncertainty visualization

(2) We report findings from a four-week field study of
a functional prototype with real users and their own
data (N=9)

(3) We propose five design recommendations for visualiz-

ing uncertainty in personal (health) data

2 RELATED WORK
This research project builds on two bodies of work: (1) work
on self-tracking technology, especially (the limited) work on
fertility tracking; and (2) work on uncertainty visualization in
HCI. Below, we will briefly summarize the two, highlighting
how previous findings informed our approach.

Self- and Fertility Tracking in HCI
Self-tracking technology has been a subject of increased pub-
lic and research interest in the last years [20, 23]. However,
despite its long tradition fertility tracking has only recently
caught HCI researchers’ attention. Fertility tracking or cycle
tracking refers to observing the events and symptoms related
to a woman’s fertility cycle. While women have recorded
their period and connected symptoms for many years, ana-
logue notes have recently been replaced by smart-phone
applications that not only record this information but use
it to predict periods and symptoms in the future. Epstein
et al. [10] investigated women’s motivations to track their
experiences with different tracking tools. They found that
the accuracy of predictions was the most important criterion
for women in menstruation tracking applications. Because
this need is currently not met by applications on the mar-
ket, Epstein et al. [10] suggest that “For both ovulation and
period arrival, designers should consider and evaluate inter-
faces that present probabilities as an alternative to unreli-
able binary predictions.” Moreover, in a recently published
study, Gambier-Ross et al. [14] noted that women are in-
terested “...in learning how the prediction methods work to
see if they were personalized based on their own data or
whether they were just based on a generic average cycle
prediction”. Their study also confirmed that accuracy and
trust are among the most important qualities of FTAs. In a
related study, Figueiredo et al. [6] analyzed publicly available
posts in an online health community dedicated to fertility in
the US. They report that for many women the topic is bound
up with taboos, social pressure, frustration and the feeling of
being inadequate. They stress that women require complex

knowledge in order to understand the fertility cycle, fertil-
ity indicators and available tools and treatments. Moreover,
Figueiredo et al. [6] highlight the inherent natural uncertain-
ties of fertility care which include unknown health issues
of reproductive organs, the vagueness of fertility indicators,
and their subjective judgment. Building on this research, we
investigate further how the uncertainty inherent in fertility
tracking and prognosis can better be communicated to users
while allowing them to make sense of the information in
relation to their personal situation and goals. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first investigation of uncertainty
communication in fertility tracking. While communicating
probabilities seems especially relevant for fertility tracking,
other self-tracking applications might benefit from it as well.
Several researchers have noted that users tend to overtrust
tracked data to the extent that they ascribe more importance
to it than to their physical feeling [19, 25]. This can be harm-
ful as sensors only track (often quite simple) selected metrics
and then systems or users infer physiological or psycholog-
ical states (e.g. health, fitness, mood, stress, fertility). As a
system can also wrongly infer that a user is stressed, un-
healthy, or infertile, some skepticism towards such systems
can be helpful to avoid unnecessary worry or concerns and
wrong decisions. The approach taken in this research project
– communicating probabilities – might, hence, be interesting
for other self-tracking applications, too.

Uncertainty in HCI
To design effective uncertainty visualizations, we reviewed
work on uncertainty within and beyond HCI. As visualiz-
ing uncertainty has a long tradition in research, we focus
this summary on findings that informed our approach. Im-
portantly, definitions and taxonomies of uncertainty vary
between and within different fields of research and often
overlap with related concepts such as accuracy and relia-
bility (e.g., [16, 21, 27, 30, 36, 37]). Within our project, we
focused on prediction accuracy and conception probability,
even though there are certainly more uncertainties involved
in fertility tracking (see section 3).

Generally, the importance of communicating accuracy,
completeness, consistency and certainty to facilitate proper
understanding of data and informed decision-making is well-
documented [1, 11, 15]. Related work on uncertainty visu-
alization and probabilities, e.g., in cartography [1, 11, 26],
meteorology [7, 28], health [35], computer vision [30], and
risk management [24] evaluated a wide range of visual vari-
ables to communicate different levels of uncertainty: Results
include that bar charts and pie charts were best suited to
represent the magnitude of probabilities and proportions,

while line charts are best for revealing trends [24, 36]. More-
over, fuzziness, location, color, size, arrangement, and trans-
parency were found to perform well in visualizing uncer-
tainty [27], with fading color and transparency being espe-
cially suitable for temporal uncertainty [18].

Recently, several researchers have investigated different
approaches to communicate uncertainty in the field of HCI,
for example of genomic data [35], bus arrival estimations [22],
and weather forecasts [16]. For the purpose of developing a
prototype to communicate uncertainty in bus arrivals, Kay
et al. [22] presented several design requirements for uncer-
tainty visualizations: uncertainty should be intrinsic to the
representation; the visualization should allow users to apply
situation-dependent risk tolerance; and it should preferably
be framed in terms of discrete outcomes or frequencies.

A large body of work on Personal Informatics and self-
tracking (e.g., sleep [4] or physical activity [32]) explored
how to present personal and often uncertain data. However,
uncertainty was rarely explored explicitly and systemati-
cally in this context. A notable exception in the personal
health data visualization space is a tool to view personal
genomic data presented by Shaer et al. [35]. These data share
some characteristics with fertility data: they are complex
and sensitive, involve multiple dimensions of uncertainty,
and can have substantial implications for the individuals’
well-being [6].

In our research project, we build on these findings and
apply them to the domain of fertility tracking and forecasts.
To study the effects of uncertainty information in this do-
main, we developed a prototype and tested it in a four-week
field study. Our findings contribute new insights about the
usefulness and potential risks and benefits of uncertainty
visualizations that are specific to the sensitive context of
personal health and family planning.

3 FIELD STUDY
To better understand the effects of communicating uncer-
tainty in fertility tracking, we conducted a mixed-method
field study with users’ real data. Below, we first explain the
uncertainty data communicated in our prototype (see fig-
ure 1), our visualization design and its limitations, and the
study’s method and results.

Uncertainty Data
Fertility data and predictions inherit various uncertainties
depending on the underlying data [12, 29]. Most commercial
applications use manually entered data such as past peri-
ods, in some cases manually measured temperature, and
additional symptoms. The analysis of the basal body temper-
ature (measured in the morning) is one of the most popular
fertility-awareness-based methods [29, 33]. Several technolo-
gies continuously measure temperature, freeing women of

the burden to remember, measure, and record every day. For
this study, we cooperated with one company that relies on
this new approach. The company VivoSensMedical provides
a temperature sensor called the OvulaRing5 that is worn
vaginally throughout the cycle where it measures the core
body temperature every five minutes to detect a temperature
shift that indicates ovulation. This technology is state-of-
the-art with studies showing that the ovulation and thus
the fertile window are identified with an accuracy of 99.11%
retrospectively and 88.8% prospectively [31]. For this project,
we used the data provided by their sensing technology and
the predictions of their algorithm. Compared to relying on
women recording their period and inferring ovulation based
on population-generic statistics, this technology provides an
accurate account of past ovulations and hence more accurate
predictions. Specifically, we integrated the following data
provided by VivoSensMedical in our visualizations:

detected ovulation: past ovulation days detected by the Ovu-
laRing algorithm based on personal temperature pattern.

predicted ovulation: predicted ovulation days calculated by
the OvulaRing algorithm based on past detected ovulations.

prediction accuracy: accuracy of the predicted ovulation day
as probability ranging from 0 to 100%, which is calculated
by the OvulaRing algorithm based on fluctuations within
past ovulation patterns. In the data used for our research
project, the prediction accuracy refers to the estimation of
the ovulation day, which is in turn used to determine the
fertile phase. The prediction accuracy does therefore not
change within one cycle or fertile phase.

conception probability: probability of conceiving on a spe-
cific day given the day of ovulation. It ranges from 0 to
30% and is based on a statistical distribution inferred from
scientific studies. This probability distribution accounts for
biological uncertainty about the exact lifetime of egg cell and
sperm and is commonly referred to as the fertile phase. Pre-
dicted ovulation (with respective fertile phase and prediction
accuracy) and conception probability together present the
uncertainty information that we integrated in our prototype.
While there are uncertainties involved in fertility tracking
that go beyond these metrics (e.g. individual lifespan of eggs
and sperm), quantifying these is currently beyond the tech-
nologies’ capabilities.

Prototype Development
Below, we briefly introduce the interactive prototype visual-
izing personal cycle data, which we developed for our field
study in several iterations of sketching, paper prototyping,
and pilot testing. To provide realistic insights, the prototype

Figure 1: Day, timeline, and calendar view showing prognosis data (orange) and detected fertile phase (blue)

was tailored to visualize data collected with the OvulaRing
sensing technology and was developed only in German (as
the participant sample recruited by VivoSensMedical was
German speaking). The final prototype was implemented as
a web application with the MEAN6 software stack and hosted
privately. We received participants’ data from VivoSensMed-
ical and manually integrated it in the prototype. The data
stored was completely anonymized to prevent any identifi-
cation of the participants.

Visualization and Interface. The prototype featured three
main views displaying users’ personal fertility data (see fig-
ure 1): a day view, a timeline view, and a calendar view. We
selected these views as they are common and widely known
layouts for cycle visualizations7 and because they performed
best in our pilot testings. To integrate the uncertainty in-
formation in these views, we reviewed potential visual vari-
ables or marks to encode prediction accuracy and conception
probability from related work. As a result, we considered
the following options: varying color value, mapping to the
traffic light color scale, or using bar charts, line charts, pie
charts, and size. We used the above mentioned pilot testing
to determine one visual mark for each uncertainty. Based on
the results we decided to display conception probability as
bar chart and to encode prediction accuracy using the traffic
light color scale (see figure 1). Notably, we decided to use

probabilities in our prototype, even though frequencies were
found to be generally easier to grasp and interpret [21, 22]
(see limitation section).

In each view, the uncertainties were displayed with visual
elements and as exact probabilistic numbers: prediction ac-
curacy in a separate view element below the header (colored
according to the traffic light color of the prediction accuracy
value) and the conception probability in the bars. Further-
more, we added a detail panel (lower part of each view) that
provides detailed information about the currently selected
day (highlighted with darker color): the conception proba-
bility, date and day of the week, the number of the current
cycle and cycle day, and the fertility status (either “infertile”
if the conception probability is 0% on the selected day or
“fertile” otherwise). Instead of replacing predicted ovulation
(and fertile phase) with detected ovulation (if ovulation has
been detected), we decided to display both next to each other
in past cycles as their co-existence illustrates the uncertainty
of predictions as well. To distinguish predicted ovulation and
detected ovulation visually, we used a dashed outline for the
predicted ovulation and colored bars of detected ovulation
in neutral blue. Arrows on top of the details panel allow
users to navigate forward and backward in time (e.g., to the
next day/cycle). To switch between the three visualizations
users need to open a menu in the side panel by clicking on a
button in the upper left corner. Finally, we included a help
page that could be accessed by clicking on the question mark

icon on the very right of the header and addressed the dif-
ferentiation between real and predicted data and explained
how to interpret the prediction accuracy and the conception
probability.

Limitations. The focus of our study was on understanding
reactions to uncertainty in the domain of fertility tracking
(rather than innovating uncertainty visualizations per se).
While our prototype served our purposes well in the con-
text of our study, we are aware of two shortcomings of our
visualizations that need to be addressed by future work:

First, the visualization of predicted and detected ovulation
data in the past (on top of each other) is not ideal: When
predicted and detected fertile phases are exactly identical, the
only visual cue of the prognosis is the dashed outline, a view
which is clearly unfavorable. This is because, we obtained the
permission to display all past ovulation data of a user after
the prototyping phase. It is often that real-world case studies
involving multiple stakeholders are exposed to unforeseeable
circumstances and opportunities, especially in the health
domain [13]. While we were aware that the visualization
can certainly be improved, we saw an opportunity to learn
about users’ reactions by displaying some visualization of
predicted data in the past. Nevertheless, based on the analysis
of our interview data and users’ journals, we are certain that
participants understood the visualization.

Second, our visualizations might be improved by using
a frequency framing, for example, implemented as icon ar-
rays. In our project, we received uncertainty data specified
as probabilities and displayed it as such. While it is possi-
ble to convert probabilities into frequencies, e.g. via draws
from a probability distribution (see [22]), we decided against
icon arrays because we considered probabilities easier to
implement and sufficient for our study purpose. However,
integrating a frequency framing in the different data views
while preserving clarity (e.g. using icon arrays in the day
view, low-density dotplots [22] in the timeline view, and icon
arrays in the calendar view) might be a promising opportu-
nity for future work to refine uncertainty visualizations of
fertility data.

Method
The prototype was evaluated in a four-week field test. We
collected data on participants’ experience and behavior in
pre- and post-study interviews as well as a diary study. To
detect and counteract any problems, participants were con-
tacted on a weekly basis to check if they had questions and
to motivate them to use both the prototype and the diary.
Below, we briefly explain pre- and post-study interviews as
well as the diary study method:

and 36 seconds) and followed an interview guideline that
included five parts: (1) an introduction of the researcher and
the study, (2) a block of interview questions including partic-
ipant’s personal context and demographic information, cycle
and cycle tracking experience; tracking goal and their per-
ceptions of and trust in prediction, (3) an explanation of the
study procedure, (4) a walk-through of the prototype website
(making clear that it is an early stage prototype) including an
explanation of prediction accuracy and conception probabil-
ity and their visualization in the prototype; participants had
the chance to ask questions right after and were encouraged
to contact the researcher at any time, (5) a walk-through of
the diary document. The interviews were conducted online
via Skype or appear.in and audio-recorded, transcribed and
coded applying the thematic analysis approach [5].

Prototype Usage: Diary Study. During the four-week study
the participants could access their own fertility data via
the prototype (in addition to accessing it via the OvulaRing
website as usual). Moreover, they had the option to check
real-time conception probability based on the temperature
pattern of the current month – a new feature released by
VivoSensMedical shortly before the study. We provided par-
ticipants with an (optionally analog or digital) diary and
instructed them to create an entry for each time they looked
at their data (preferably on the prototype if possible). The
input fields of the diary were beginnings of sentences that
the participant could complete, (e.g., "Today, I used the proto-
tyope to..."). These sentences aimed to elicit the participant’s
reason for the visit, interesting or confusing insights gained
from the presented data, perceptions of the prediction accu-
racy and conception probability, as well as perceptions of the
current reliability of the prognosis. Additionally, there was
space for any other comments. After four weeks the diaries
were sent back to the study leader in order to inform the
post-study interview questions.

Post-Study Interviews. Post-study interviews took on average
one hour and covered six topics: (a) experiences made during
the study, (b) knowledge gained, (c) prototype website usage
(participants’ diaries were used to refer to specific usage in-
stances; vague/ unclear entries were clarified), (d) usefulness
of available cycle information and risk perception, (e) relia-
bility of cycle data and tracking technology, (f) usability of
the prototype website. Again, the dialog was audio-recorded,
transcribed and coded immediately after each interview. The
results were then used to iteratively adjust the interview
guidelines for subsequent interviews. Participants’ quotes in
this paper were translated from German.

Pre-Study Interviews. The semi-structured pre-study inter-
views took between 30 and 60 minutes (mean: 56 minutes

Ethics. The study procedure complied with university ethics
regulations. In addition, the recruitment and data handling

was accompanied by VivoSensMedical and we recruited par-
ticipants from their study volunteers pool. Participants had
tracked their cycle for at least one and at most 50 cycles (see
table 1). Prior to the study the OvulaRing system showed
predicted ovulation data in the future as well as detected
ovulation data in the past with no uncertainty information.
Predicted data disappeared when ovulation was detected.
Potential participants received a personal explanation of the
study purpose, procedure and the uncertainty prototype. Af-
ter they opted in and signed informed consent, they received
personal access credentials that allowed them to view their
OvulaRing data via the mobile study prototype website.

Participants
Nine women participated in the field study (aged between
22 and 43 years). Thereof, three women reported to use the
sensor technology primarily for contraception, three were
trying to become pregnant, and three primarily tracked to
observe their body and secondarily to apply natural contra-
ception (see Table 2).

Results
Our study shed light on users’ perceptions of and reactions
to the uncertainty metrics and our visualizations. Below, we
will describe results related to three aspects: (A) the perfor-
mance of visual elements in communicating uncertainties,
(B) participants’ interpretations and emotions related to con-
ception probability and prediction accuracy, (C) the impact
of conception probability and prediction accuracy on par-
ticipants’ risk perception, trust, and behavior. Even though
some of the presented results are not directly related to the
designed visualizations, they provide important insights for
the design of uncertainty visualizations.

(A) Deviations between predicted and detected ovulation in past
data were more effective in communicating uncertainty than
prediction accuracy and traffic light color-coding. To commu-
nicate uncertainty, we visualized the conception probability

as bar charts and the prediction accuracy as traffic light color-
coding (in addition to displaying the exact value). Moreover,
we intentionally displayed both predicted and detected ovula-
tion in past cycles. Below, we briefly summarize participants’
perceptions of these visual elements:

bar charts displaying conception probability. Generally, the
bar charts were well perceived and understood (in combi-
nation with explicit numbers). Most participants found the
information interesting (P2, P4, P6, P7, P8, P9) and useful.
For example, P8 who used the information to become preg-
nant said: “the better you understand it, the better you can
target”(P8). Four participants were surprised by the general
trend and the low maximum values of the conception prob-
ability (P2, P4, P7, P9). Nevertheless, some interpretation
problems occurred: P3 and P8 were not aware that the con-
ception probability was based on past studies. Lastly, P6 and
P7 pointed out that the conception probability is not relevant
for contraception, they only wanted to know if additional
protection was needed or not.

probabilities specifying prediction accuracy. Two thirds of
participants required an explanation in order to understand
the current prediction accuracy and its changes over time.
P1, P2, P5, and P6 wanted to know how the probability was
calculated and why it changed: “Yes, that was really helpful
to understand now that this is calculated based on past cy-
cles”(P5). P6 and P8 confused the prediction accuracy with
the conception probability: “Yes, I think at this point the
two were still confused in my head: conception probability
and prediction accuracy”(P3). Nevertheless, all participants
found the prediction accuracy generally interesting and use-
ful with P7 and P8 being slightly less interested. Lastly, P6
and P9 stressed the importance of the prediction accuracy
for contraception purposes.

encoding of prediction accuracy according to the traffic light
color scale. The traffic light color-coding was only noticed
by four women during the study - despite an explanation
in the beginning (P1, P2, P4, P8). While they appreciated its
visual appeal, the fact that more than half did not recognize it
suggests that the color-coding is not suitable to communicate
the prediction accuracy on its own. P3 missed the option of
a part-to-whole comparison since the whole color scale was
only visible on the help page (due to limited screen space).

deviation between predicted and detected ovulation. Dis-
playing both predicted and detected ovulation in past cycles
showed to be a more effective way to increase users’ aware-
ness of potential uncertainties than the prediction accuracy.
Seven participants appreciated the option to compare real
and predicted data in past cycles (P1, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8.
P1 had noticed before the study that her cycle deviated from
the prognosis and used the visualizations to examine these

CHI 2019, May 4–9, 2019, Glasgow, Scotland UK

deviations further. For women who were not aware of the
existence or the extent of possible deviations before (P3, P7),
seeing the differences was surprising and helped to clar-
ify and illustrate the meaning of prediction accuracy. P3,
for example, commented on a deviation: “that would have
made it really clear for the third cycle, this is really... it just
does not coincide. And that’s how the prediction accuracy
comes about” (P3). In general, the timeline view visualized
deviations better than the calendar view. In some cases, the
relation or difference between predicted and detected ovu-
lation was unclear – especially when predicted and actual
fertile phases overlapped completely or not at all. In several
cases, the combination of prediction accuracy and deviation
between predicted and detected ovulation led to confusion:
P5, for example, was confused by a large deviation of a fertile
phase predicted with 90% prediction accuracy while a com-
pletely correct prognosis showed 47% prediction accuracy.
The explanation that the prediction accuracy was calculated
based on previous cycles, helped her to understand.

(B) Prediction accuracy and conception probability affected
participants’ self-confidence and emotions. Five participants
drew conclusions on their health and fertility based on the
prediction accuracy. Although these results are not directly
related to uncertainty visualization design, they can help to
inform it: On the positive side, P2 and P9 interpreted a high
prediction accuracy of 90% and 79% as signs of high regularity
and fertility leaving them with a positive feeling. Similarly,
P4 (using the technology to become pregnant) also related
the increase of prediction accuracy from 20% to 30% to her
cycle becoming more healthy: “That gave me a bit of hope
again, I thought it was great.” She also felt that her chances
for conception improved as the rise in prediction accuracy
reflected for her “this being healthy”. While a further increase
in prediction accuracy would increase her self-confidence,
she would experience a decrease as “a slap in the face” (P4).
Similarly, P2 feared that a low prediction accuracy could
cause pressure and the feeling of something being wrong. For
example, she had experienced one cycle without ovulation
as a shock. Thus, she imagined that women with a very
irregular cycle might feel bad about seeing it reflected in a
low prediction accuracy. In contrast, P8 stated that she had
accepted her irregular and hard-to-predict cycle a long time
ago and thus the low prediction accuracy of 20% did not affect
her emotionally. Two women (P2, P4) stated that changes
in color (based on the traffic light color scale) intensify the
emotional impact of the prediction accuracy indicating that
design elements can amplify or mitigate such feelings.

Prediction accuracy changes can also influence feelings
of safety, especially of contraception users. P6 described
that it made a difference for her whether the prognosis was
92% accurate or 75%. She explained that even though a low

prediction accuracy was reason for concerns, “having the
information at the same time decreases my worries again”. P9
was shocked when viewing low prediction accuracy levels
of for example 47% or 33% in past cycles: “At that time, I
was using it for contraception, that’s really crazy actually,
that nothing happened but ok...” Further, she stated that she
would only rely on a prognosis with at least 80% prediction
accuracy in the future.

Conception probability affected participants’ emotions to
some extent as well: P5, for example, found it relaxing to
know that the conception probability was at most 30%. She
concluded that trying to become pregnant without success
did not necessarily mean that something was wrong with
her. However, P4 was discouraged by the same values as they
decreased her hope of becoming pregnant in the near future.
Conversely, the low conception probability of 17% raised
P3’s hope when she was fearing an unintentional pregnancy.

(C) Prediction accuracy and deviations between predicted and
detected ovulation affected participants’ risk awareness and
behavior. The prediction accuracy and deviations between
predicted and detected ovulation affected the risk awareness
and behavior of some participants but not of others (P2, P5).
In the latter group, P2 found the information nice to know,
but it had no impact on her daily life. Similarly, P5 used the
technology “more as a back-up” and to improve her body
knowledge and P1, P2, and P5 stated that they did not rely
solely on a prognosis before the study either. P2 stated: “Trust
is good, control is better. [...] I rather trust the accompanying
symptoms” (P2).

On the contrary, P7 stated to rely on the prognosis despite
the prediction accuracy being lower than expected (30% in-
stead of 95%) while using the technology for contraception.
She explained: “that’s my trust in the matter; I rely on it and
fare very well with it for two years.” (P7) However, seeing
deviations between predicted and detected ovulation in past
data did increase her risk awareness: “Yes, yes, it is dangerous
then [laughs]” (P7). Similarly, observing deviations decreased
trust in the prognosis for P1, P4, and P6 and impacted their
behavior. As a consequence, P1 decided to investigate the
cause of the deviation further and P4 and P6 checked the
real-time conception probability (P4 to become pregnant and
P6 for contraception). On this occasion, P4 found a positive
conception probability (8 days before predicted ovulation
and one day before detected ovulation) and intentionally got
pregnant. While P6 felt safe with a prediction accuracy of
92%, a decrease to 70% caused her to “add more safety mar-
gin around the predicted fertile phase” (P6). Moreover, two
participants stated that bigger deviation between predicted
and detected ovulation or lower prediction accuracy might
lead to a loss of interest in the prognosis (P4, P5).

4 DISCUSSION
Deciding if and how to integrate uncertainty information in
health technologies is highly complex. Although, our study
results cannot answer these questions conclusively, they
shed light on several benefits and drawbacks of displaying
uncertainty. Moreover, we propose several design recommen-
dations for uncertainty visualizations in health technologies
and beyond.

Positive and Negative Impact of Accuracy Indicators
Increasing Complexity. The field of cycle tracking is very
complex due to the biological processes involved [6]. Intro-
ducing uncertainty indicators adds to this complexity and
poses new challenges for users. While some participants
naturally started calculating the aggregated probability of
conception for multiple cycles, others confused the meaning
of the different probabilities. For example, in one case a user
assumed that a prediction accuracy of 10% in combination
with a conception probability of 17% indicated a low risk of
pregnancy. Later she realized that a low prediction accuracy
actually indicated a higher risk due to the increased uncer-
tainty. Moreover, the lack of knowledge about the origin of
the uncertainty information caused interpretation problems.
One participant thought that the conception probability was
based on her cycle data and not retrieved in medical studies.
Other participants did not know that the prediction accuracy
was based on the variance in the data of their completed
cycles. Thus, they were not able to make sense of prediction
accuracy changes and trends. However, we also found that
most participants were interested in the additional uncer-
tainty information and preferred to use the system with this
information. Hence, making the meaning of uncertainty indi-
cators understandable, tangible, and concrete is a challenge
for future research and interaction designers.

Knowledge Gain. Most participants found it interesting to
learn about the conception probability regardless of their cy-
cle tracking goal, whether just out of curiosity or to optimize
their attempts to become pregnant. Learning about the com-
parably high chances of a pregnancy on six days caused one
women to stop focusing solely on the day of ovulation and
to extend her conception attempts to the given time range.
Similarly, users reported that the prediction accuracy and
deviations between predicted and detected ovulation helped
them to understand how the ovulation detection and the
prognosis calculation actually worked. Hence, uncertainty
indicators may help users to reflect on and better understand
the technology they use, which may help them to develop
appropriate expectations.

Emotional Impact. In the case of cycle tracking, displaying
uncertainty indicators had a huge emotional impact on par-
ticipants. The prediction accuracy was often interpreted as
an indicator of cycle health – as a more regular cycle will
lead to a higher accuracy. However, cycle health is asso-
ciated with a strong emotional burden for many women,
especially when it comes to the desire to have children [6].
Our study results showed that a decreasing accuracy can
have a strong negative and an increasing accuracy a strong
positive emotional impact on these women. Enhancing the
prediction accuracy with a traffic light color coding amplified
this effect. Based on these observations, we recommend to
refrain from displaying metrics that are likely interpreted as
"health index" or as judgmental. A less emotionally straining
way to indicate uncertainty is to display deviations between
predicted and detected ovulation in past data.

Safety Indicator. Some of the women using cycle tracking
for contraception purposes interpreted the prediction ac-
curacy as a safety indicator. For example, they mentioned
personal prediction accuracy thresholds which had to be
met for them to rely on the prognosis. Even though low
accuracy caused feelings of insecurity, the study results sug-
gest that women prefer having this information as it allows
them to apply safety precautions. On the contrary, such in-
dicators might also lead to contraception users relying fully
on the predicted fertile phase when facing high accuracy,
which might be reason for concern: After all the prognosis
is a statistical measure and does not consider other sources
of uncertainty such as real-time influences on the cycle in-
cluding, e.g., stress or illness. For these reasons we would
recommend to refrain from displaying accuracy in this form.
Nevertheless, its ability to raise awareness of uncertainty,
to create realistic expectations and inform responsible be-
haviour is promising. Future work needs to investigate how
the usefulness of accuracy indicators can be maximized while
limiting their negative effects.

Users’ Trust in Prognosis and Provider. One reason to refrain
from displaying uncertainty data for companies is that it
might decrease trust in their company/brand. In contrast, we
found in our study that uncertainty data decreased trust in
the prognosis (a desirable result when avoiding unwanted
pregnancies is the goal) but it increased trust in the provider
company. When competitors feature technology that is seem-
ingly infallible, the challenge will be to communicate the
advantages of transparency and uncertainty data.

Design Recommendations
We conclude this paper with several design recommenda-
tions for uncertainty visualizations of personal data such as
fertility and health.

CHI 2019, May 4–9, 2019, Glasgow, Scotland UK

Show Past or Future Errancy. The displayed deviations be-
tween real and predicted data in completed cycles was easier
for participants to grasp than the prediction accuracy and
gave them a better idea of potential risks. In addition to that,
a negative emotional impact and reduction of the perception
of risk could not be observed. Furthermore, it helped them
understand how the prognosis works. Hence, we recommend
to display deviations or algorithmic errors in past data and to
explore visualization techniques that show potential errors
in the future.

Use Visuals. The use of additional visual representations of
the uncertainties was appreciated by the study participants.
According to them, the visuals used made the meaning of the
probabilities clearer and even had an eye-opening effect for
some. Especially the women who disliked working with num-
bers were fond of the visualizations. However, it is important
to choose appropriate visual representations and here we
see definite room for improvement by future work: While
the conception probability bars in our study performed well,
the color mapping of the prediction accuracy was barely rec-
ognized especially if the changes between cycles were small.
Furthermore, as mentioned before, future work might focus
on framing uncertainties in fertility tracking as frequencies
(for example using icon arrays or low-density dotplots [22])
– as this technique has yielded promising results in other
domains as well.

Provide Goal-based Interpretation Aids. Since the prototype
targeted women with different cycle tracking goals generic
interpretation aids were not possible. For example, contracep-
tion users should be made aware of low prediction accuracy
levels by all means (e.g. red color or exclamation marks)
whereas for women who try to conceive additional emphasis
on low prediction accuracy levels would cause unnecessary
stress. Hence, symbolic or verbal interpretation assistance
need to be adapted to the user’s tracking purpose. One par-
ticipant would have preferred a message like “Attention! No
reliable prediction possible” accompanying a low prediction
accuracy. This could on the one hand reduce the cognitive
load and prevent misinterpretation, but on the other hand
the user is tempted to follow predefined recommendations
instead of making her own informed decisions based on the
data. Consequently, the interpretation aids should be subtle
and rather assist in understanding the data than in making
decisions based on it.

Explain on the Spot. The required knowledge for understand-
ing the cycle data presented needs to be accessible for the
user where it is required. Most of the participants did not
access the help section of the prototype app even though
they required additional information on the uncertainties.
In addition to that, some who visited it could not find the

information they required. Hence, finding out which knowl-
edge is needed by the participants in order to interpret their
cycle data has to be the first step. Thereafter, methods for
effective communication can be elaborated. For desktop so-
lutions such explanations on the spot could be integrated
as informative overlays, explanatory figures or little anima-
tions triggered by hovering the concerning information. On
mobile applications, separate buttons next to the referenced
information might be necessary (like for example provided
by Clue). How uncertainty information can be explained on
demand is an interesting and important topic for future work
in cycle tracking.

Personalize. Cycle tracking is highly personal as cycle char-
acteristics and the occurrence of symptoms do not only vary
between women but also from cycle to cycle [8, 14]. In our
study, we found unsurprisingly that explanation and feed-
back were much more effective when they were based on
their personal data. Ideally, explanation will also take users
personal needs into account (e.g., emotionally involved, lack
of knowledge...). Presumably, personalizing FTAs appropri-
ately is not as simple as classifying the users by cycle tracking
goal. FTAs with different modes tailored to the information
and interpretation needs of specific user groups could be a
potential solution.

5 CONCLUSION
We contribute an exploration of the design possibilities and
consequences of communicating uncertainty in FTAs. De-
spite the increased complexity, most women appreciated re-
ceiving information on uncertainty. However, we also found
that prediction accuracy was interpreted as representation
of cycle health and caused women trying to conceive high
levels of emotional stress.

Moreover, women using the technology for contraception
might rely fully on the predicted fertile phase when faced
with high prediction accuracy. Showing deviations between
prognosis and detected ovulation in past cycle data helped
users to understand uncertainties in predictions without
causing negative emotional effects and reducing users’ risk
perception. Beyond showing algorithmic errancy in past data,
we recommend to use visual representations for uncertainty,
to integrate goal-based interpretation aids and uncertainty
explanations on the spot that refer to personal cycle charac-
teristics and are personalized to users’ needs.
