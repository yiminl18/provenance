ABSTRACT 
Technology  helps  us  get  work  done  but  also  provides 
many  distractions.    As  a  result,  seemingly  unproductive 
activities  such  as  social  networking  sites  (SNS)  cause 
considerable stress. This paper reports a series of studies 
into  whether  personal

INTRODUCTION 
The  ubiquity  of  modern  technologies  has  revolutionised 
how  people  complete  daily  tasks.  Individuals  are  more 
reliant on computers than ever before, and while this has 
made a number of activities easier and quicker, it has also 
increased the opportunities for interruption. Not only can 
individuals  be  actively  notified  of  incoming  information 
in the form of e-mails and instant messages, but they also 
have  easy  access  to  a  number  of  other  sources  of 
distraction.  While  in  some  workplaces,  internet  access 
may  be  restricted  or  monitored,  thus  removing  the 
temptation 
to  access  distractions  such  as  social 
networking  sites  (SNS),  this is  not  the  case  for  students. 
Like knowledge workers, their productivity relies heavily 
on their own time management and therefore distractions 
by anything deemed to be unproductive may be especially

stressful. 

Students  are  the  most  prolific  users  of  SNS  [11],  and 
despite being able to use SNS in various productive ways 
from  coordinating  meetings 
to  working  on  shared 
assignments, they do report SNS use to be a considerable 
source  of  stress  [9].  This  stress  may  be,  at  least  in  part, 
reliant  on  an  inaccurate  perception  of  how  much  time 
individuals  spend  on  SNS.  Junco  [10]  found  that  self-
reported SNS use was almost six times higher than their 
actual  use,  as  measured  by  logging  software.  Efforts  to 
make individuals more aware of their actual level of use 
may have a positive impact on how stressed they feel, and 
personal  informatics  (PI)  tools  seem  particularly  well-
suited to achieving this.  

Consequently, a number of PI tools have been developed 
with  the  aim  of  supporting  users  in  becoming  more 
(cid:181)productive(cid:182).  These  tools  allow  individuals  to  view 
automatically  collected  data  on  how  many  hours  they 
work,  how  long  they  spend  on  particular  documents  and 
when  they  have  been  distracted  by  non-work  related 
applications, such as SNS. While this information should 
be  highly  valuable  to  anyone  seeking  to  improve  their 
productivity (even if just to confirm that their SNS use is 
not  impacting  negatively  on  their  work),  it  is  currently 
unclear  whether  PI  tools  are  actually  successful  in  this 
aim. Research in other domains indicates that PI tools are 
often  ineffective  at  facilitating  behaviour  change.  For

increase physical activity, a recent study found that 26% 
were found to have only be used once and 74% were used 
fewer than ten times [5]. Similarly, over 50% of wearable 
activity trackers have been found to be discarded after 6 
months  [7],  indicating  that  simply  owning  these  devices 
or applications does not mean that they are engaged with 
or  that  the  information  is  applied  to  behaviour.  Previous 
work  assessing  the  use  of  other  tools  that  provide 
feedback  to  change  behaviour,  namely  a  household 
energy  monitor,  reported  that  once  the  initial  novelty  of 
owning  the  device  wore  off,  users  disengaged  and 
remained  unmotivated

tools  for  productivity  would  be  effective  in  helping 
students  monitor  SNS  use  in  a  way  that  would  be 
beneficial in terms of changing behaviour or reducing the 
stress related to these sites.  

to  change 

However, there is research to suggest that people respond 
well to visualizations of their computer usage, and believe 

interestingly,  participants  did  not  reduce  the  amount  of 
time they spent on SNS.  

Zhou et al [16] had used retrospective estimations, and so 
participants  had  to  wait  until  they  had  made  their 
estimation  before  checking  RescueTime  to  see  how 
accurate  their  estimate  had  been.  However,  PI  tools  are 
not  just  effective  at  recording  past  behaviour;  they  can 
also be used to help set goals for future behaviour, a tactic 
well  established  in  the  behaviour  change  literature  [15]. 
We  decided  to  investigate  whether  making  prospective 
estimates  about  future  SNS  usage  would  not  only  have 
the  same  benefits  as  retrospective  estimates  but  also 
encourage a change in SNS behaviour.  

Very  little  research  exists  in  relation  to  the  differential 
effect  of  prospective  and  retrospective  estimations. 
Despite  arguments  for  a  dissociation  between  the  two  in 
terms  of  the  required  processes  [3]  (and  consequently, 
possible  outcomes),  there  is  general  agreement  that  both 
rely  heavily  on  memory  [2].  Therefore,  outcomes  of 
prospective  estimations, 
those  of  retrospective 
like 
estimations, may increase awareness of SNS use. This has 
implications  for  attempts  to  decrease  SNS  related  stress, 
but also more broadly for the effective design of personal

It was therefore hypothesized that estimations of SNS use 
would significantly improve over the course of the study 
as participants gained an awareness of their actual levels 
of  usage.  It  was  also  predicted  that  with  improved 
estimations  would  come  reduced  stress  and  improved 
perception  of  time  management  skills,  as  participants

Once again, this is in line with the findings of Zhou et al 
[16]  and  the  theoretical  importance  of  prospective 
estimations  in  goal  setting.  A  final  hypothesis  was  that 
there  would  be  a  reduction  in  SNS  usage  because 
prospective  estimations  would  encourage  participants  to 
set goals.

Participants 
A  total  of  16  taught  postgraduate  students  took  part 
(seven  of  whom  were  female),  aged  between  22-28 
(M=23.75,  S.D.=1.76).  The  study  was  conducted  during 
the summer period, during which time postgraduates were 
still  studying  and  attending  classes  but  did  not  have 
exams.  They  were  recruited  by  posters  in  university

buildings  and  by  advertisements  on

interested 
specifically 
in

intrinsic  motivation.  Additional 
minimum 
extrinsic  motivation  to  adhere  to  the  study  protocol  was 
provided  by  informing  the  participants  that  for  every

that it will help them make better use of their time [1].  Li 
and  colleagues  [12]  found  that  people  tend  to  reflect  on 
automatically  collected  information  as  it  is  readily 
available and avoids the typical difficulties experienced in 
the  manual  collection  and  integration  of  personal  data, 
such  as  having  to  organize  the  information  or  remember 
to record it.  

Additional  evidence  that  PI  tools  could  be  beneficial  in 
this  context  comes  from  Zhou  et  al  [16].    In  that  study, 
participants  completed  questionnaire  measures  of  stress 
and  time  management  behaviours,  and  having  installed 
RescueTime  (a  tool  that  tracks  productivity),  were  then 
asked to provide daily estimations of how much time they 
thought they had spent on SNS so far that day. This task 
motivated participants to check their RescueTime data to 
assess how accurate their estimate had been, and provided 
a  measure  of  the  discrepancy  between  perceived  and 
actual SNS use. It was found that (cid:83)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:76)(cid:83)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:86)(cid:182) estimation 
accuracy  significantly  improved  over  the  two  weeks  of 
estimations. Interestingly, participants also experienced a 
reduction in their perceived stress and an increase in their 
satisfaction with  their  levels of SNS use.  This  suggested 
that a lack of awareness of the actual time spent on SNS 
could  be  an  important  factor  in  the  relationship  between 
SNS  use  and  subjective  stress,  and  that  RescueTime 
could  help  bring  about  this  awareness.  However,  there 
was  no  change  in  the  actual  amount  of  time  spent  on 
SNS.  This  provides  further  evidence  for  the  hypothesis 
that although PI tools are effective in raising awareness of 
behaviour,  there  are  situations  in  which  they  may  be 
ineffective at facilitating behaviour change.

In  order  to further  investigate  the  effects  of  RescueTime 
on  awareness  of  SNS  use,  the  perceived  stress  of  this 
activity and behaviour change, we adopted an in-the-wild 
design.    This  paper  therefore  describes  two  attempts  at 
replicating  and  extending  (cid:82)(cid:73) (cid:61)(cid:75)(cid:82)(cid:88) (cid:72)(cid:87) (cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:182)(cid:86) (cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:76)(cid:74)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:68)(cid:79) (cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:88)(cid:71)(cid:92)

change  as  a  result  of  using  the  PI  tool,  and  only  limited 
evidence for an increase in awareness of actual behaviour.  
One explanation for this may be the relatively low levels 
of  engagement  with  RescueTime.  We  therefore  carried 
out an interview study that identified several barriers that 
inhibit  engagement  with  RescueTime  that  may  have 
impacted  on  the  participants  involved  in  the  previous 
studies.  In  particular,  the  way  RescueTime  presents  user 
data  lacks:  salience;  contextual  information;  credibility; 
and  action  advice.  We  discuss  the  implications  of  our 
findings for in-the-wild experimental studies into the use 
of PI tools and for the design of such tools.

Introduction 
As stated above, Zhou et al [16] identified that providing 
daily  retrospective  estimations  by  phone  (that 
is, 
estimating  how  much  time  they  had  spent  on  SNS  from 
when  they  woke  up  until  they  received  the  phone  call) 
encouraged  participants  to  refer  to  RescueTime  and 
consequently  improve  the  accuracy  of  their  estimations. 
Participants  also  reported  a  reduction  in  stress,  although

Stress  was  measured  by  the  10  item  Perceived  Stress

a seven point Likert scale. 

The questionnaire also contained a question enquiring as 
to  how  stressed  they  felt  about  their  SNS  use  and  how 
satisfied  they  were  with  their  current  level  of  use,  both 
answerable on a seven point Likert scale, ranging from 1 
(not at all) to 7 (very much so). 

RescueTime  was  used  to  measure  the  amount  of  time 
spent accessing SNS, in particular, Facebook. Participants 
were  provided  with  a  premium  account  which  allowed

there  was  a  significant  increase  in  the  TMB  total  score 
following  the  estimation  period  (t=-4.38,  p<.01).  There 
were no changes in any of the other measures (see Tables

SNS use 
Actual SNS usage did not change over the 10 day period 
(Figure  2).  The  amount  of  time  spent  using  SNS  ranged 
from 0 to 4993 seconds (83 minutes 13 seconds), and the 
average  amount  of  time  spent  on  them  over  the  10  days 
was 1272 seconds (21 minutes 12 seconds).  

Figure 1. Example display of RescueTime data 

Procedure 
Participants were first asked to install RescueTime on all 
their  personal  computers  and  smartphones.  Information 
on their SNS usage was collected for a two week period 
while  the  application  was  in  restricted  mode  (meaning 
participants  were  unable  to  access  their  own  data),  in 
order to provide an indication of baseline SNS use.   

Participants  completed  the  above  questionnaires,  were 
granted access to their RescueTime data and then began a 
two week period during which they received daily phone 
calls. These phone calls asked them to estimate how long 
they  expected  to  spend  on  SNS  from  the  phone  call  to 
when  they  went  to  sleep.  They  were  made  at  random 
times  between  noon  and  midnight  on  weekdays  only.  If 
they did not answer the call, the same question was sent 
to  them  by  text  message,  and  if  they  did  not  respond 
within  five  minutes,  this was  recorded  as  a  missing  data

RescueTime 
The  mean  number  of  days  RescueTime  was  accessed 
during the 10 days was 4.13 (S.D.=3.34), ranging from 0 
to  10,  with  the  average  visit  lasting  for  78.91  seconds. 
The overall average amount of time spent on RescueTime

amount of time spent on RescueTime (r=.659, p<.05) and 
the frequency with which it was accessed (r=.787, p<.01). 
Both  the  amount  of  time  and  the  frequency  were  also 
positively  correlated  with  the  TMB  Mechanics  subscale

However,  there  were  no  differences  in  any  of  the

times during the experimental period) with those who did 
not.

Discussion 
This  study  aimed  to  investigate  the  effect  of  using 
RescueTime,  a  PI  productivity  tool,  and  to  explore 
whether  it  could  be  used  in  conjunction  with  daily 
prospective  estimations  of  SNS  usage.  In  particular,  we 
hypothesised that getting participants to think about their 
future behaviour might encourage goal setting and lead to 
changes  in  their  SNS  use  or  increased  awareness  and 
acceptance of current SNS use.  However, there were no 
significant  changes  in  (cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72) (cid:83)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:76)(cid:83)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:86)(cid:182) SNS  behaviour, 
indicating that prospective estimations may not encourage 
goal setting, or if they do, this may not result in behaviour 
change. There is evidence that participant(cid:86)(cid:182) awareness of 
their behaviour increased as their prospective estimations 
were  originally  highly  inaccurate  but  improved  over  the 
course  of  the  study.  This  accompanied  an  increase  in 
perceived  time  management  behaviours,  but  contrary  to 
predictions, there were no differences in perceived stress 
before and after the estimation period. These findings are 
partly in keeping with existing literature, which suggests 
that  individuals  overestimate  their  SNS  usage  [10]  and 
that tasks encouraging greater reflection on SNS use can 
improve  these  estimations  [16].  However,  these  results 
also suggest that improving estimations in itself does not 
guarantee a reduction in stress. 

Several  possibilities  exist  as  to  why  this  study  did  not 
replicate  the  findings  of  Zhou  et  al  [16].  The  most 
significant  difference  between  the  present  investigation 
and  Zhou  et  al  [16]  is  the  kind  of  estimation  being 
investigated.  It  is  therefore  possible  that  this  discovery 
reflects 
the  nature  of  prospective  estimations,  and 
indicates  that  conceptualizing  SNS  use  in  this  manner  is 
not effective in reducing stress. This is perhaps due to the 
approach  of  goal  setting  not  being  as  valuable  when  the 
main  aim  is  not  behaviour  change  per  se,  but  more 
increasing awareness of existing behaviours.  

the  different  results  may  also  reflect 
Conversely, 
differences in the amount of SNS use in the two groups of 
participants.    The  sample  in  this  study  consisted  of 

postgraduate  rather  than  undergraduate  students,  and 
perhaps  due  to  having  greater  workloads,  the  level  of 
SNS  use  was  much  lower  (the  average  daily  use  was 
12.82  minutes,  compared  to 51.14  minutes in  Zhou  et al 
[16]). This could mean that participants felt that the tool 
was  simply  not  needed.    However,  in  the  present  study, 
satisfaction  with  SNS  use  was  not  substantially  higher 
(cid:11)(cid:23)(cid:17)(cid:23)(cid:21) (cid:82)(cid:88)(cid:87) (cid:82)(cid:73) (cid:26)(cid:15) (cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:71) (cid:87)(cid:82) (cid:61)(cid:75)(cid:82)(cid:88) (cid:72)(cid:87) (cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:182)(cid:86) (cid:23)(cid:17)(cid:19)(cid:25)(cid:12)(cid:15) (cid:86)(cid:88)(cid:74)(cid:74)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)
this may not entirely be responsible.        

One  of  the  most  interesting,  and  potentially  most 
influential,  differences  between  the  present  and  previous 
investigations  is  the  variation  in  the  frequency  of 
accessing RescueTime. On average, participants accessed 
RescueTime  4.13  times  during  the  10  day  experimental 
period, compared to Zhou et al [16], in which the average 
number of days was 6.94. A second interesting aspect of 
this  is  why  engagement  was  lower  than  has  been 
previously observed. Once again, this may be due to the 
nature  of  prospective  compared 
retrospective 
to 
in  accessing  or 
estimations.  The  added  difficulty 
remembering  the  relevant  information  for  prospective 
estimation  may  therefore  be  a  substantial  barrier  in 
participants  using  RescueTime  in  this  context.  Although 
there are options within the application to set goals, as no 
participants in the present experiment chose to do this, it 
is  possible  that  this  process  needs  to  be  made  easier  or 
quicker in order to be useful. 

the  need 

to  continue 

Alternatively,  it  is  possible  that  checking  RescueTime 
once would be sufficient to realise the first estimation had 
incorrect  and  adjust  expectations  accordingly, 
been 
removing 
to  engage  with 
RescueTime.  That  said,  for  participants  who  only 
accessed RescueTime once or twice, this tended to occur 
on  day  two  or  three  and  then  towards  the  end  on  days 
nine  or  ten.  This  therefore  suggests  that  even  for  those 
without substantial interest in engaging with RescueTime, 
it  did  not  appear  to  be  a  case  of  checking  once  at  the 
beginning  and  feeling  satisfied  that  this  information  was 
sufficient.  

It  is  consequently  clear  that  despite  these  interesting 
findings, several questions remain. Without a comparison 
group,  it  is  impossible  to  ascertain  whether  the  different 
results gained from the present study and Zhou et al [16] 
are  in  fact  due  to  the  type  of  estimation  or  the  other 
factors  that  distinguish  the  two  studies.  Lower  overall 
SNS use and less frequent RescueTime access cannot be 
ruled out as influential in this study, and it was therefore 
necessary  to  further  explore  these  possibilities  with  a 
second experiment.  

STUDY 2 

Introduction 
The findings of Study 1 indicated that asking participants 
to  make  daily  prospective  estimations  of  their  SNS  use 
and providing them with RescueTime data could improve 
their  awareness  of  SNS  and  potentially,  improve  their 
perception  of  time  management  skills.  However,  the 
aforementioned  questions  that  still  remained  regarding 
the  generalizability  of  these  findings  and  the  issues  with 

373

very  low  levels  of  RescueTime  use  required  further 
investigation.  

This study therefore aimed to combine the approaches of 
Study  1  and  Zhou  et  al  [16]  and  directly  compare 
prospective  and  retrospective  estimations,  while  also 
testing  these  against  a  control  group  who  provided  no 
estimations.  Based  on  the  previous  findings,  it  was 
hypothesised that across both estimation conditions there 
would be an increase in accuracy across the experimental 
period.  Moreover,  it  was  predicted  that  retrospective 
estimations  would  be  accompanied  by  a  reduction  in 
perceived  stress,  and  that  prospective  estimations  would 
be accompanied by an improvement in time management 
behaviour. The latter prediction was based on the findings 
of Study 1, and was therefore only a tentative hypothesis. 
We were also interested in whether evidence of behaviour 
change  would  be  present,  particularly  in  the  prospective 
condition  considering  the  aforementioned  importance  of 
goal setting in behaviour change theories.  

Method 

Participants 
A  total  of  30  participants  were  recruited  (18  of  whom 
were  female),  aged  between  18  and  25  (M=20.33, 
S.D.=1.54). All were undergraduate students who mostly 
used  their  own  personal  laptops  and  computers.  They 
were recruited towards the end of the first term and so did 
not  have  any  impending  exams.  Once  again,  the  advert 
targeted those intrinsically motivated to monitor and take 
interest  in  their  SNS  data,  and  extrinsic  motivation  was 
provided  by  entry  into  a  prize  draw  reliant  on  timely 
estimations.  

Materials 
As  in  the  previous  study,  the  TMB  scale  ((cid:302)=.819-.855) 
was  used  to  measure  self-perceived  time  management 
skills  [13],  and 
the  PSS  ((cid:302)=.892-.894)  measured 
subjective  stress  [4].  Participants  were  also  asked  about 
their attitudes towards SNS, their perception of SNS as a 
stressor  and  how  satisfied  they  were  with  their  current 
level of use. RescueTime was once again used to measure
SNS usage.  

Procedure 
The same procedure was followed as in Study 1, with the 
exception  that  instead  of  a  daily  phone-call,  participants 
received  a  text  message,  sent  at  random  times  during 
working hours every week day for a total of two weeks. 
This  was  intended  to  keep  response  methods  constant 
across participants, irrespective of whether they were able 
to  answer  the  phone,  and  to  allow  for  responses  to  be 
collected  in  situations  in  which  a  phone-call  may  not  be 
possible,  for  instance,  during  lectures.  Participants  were 

instructed  that  they  must  respond  within  five  minutes  in 
order  to  remain  in  the  prize  draw  for  extra  Amazon 
vouchers.   

This  text  asked  them  to  estimate  how  much  time  they 
spent  on  SNS  yesterday  (for  the  retrospective  group)  or 
how  much  they  thought  they  would  spend  on  SNS 
tomorrow  (the  prospective  group).  This  was  slightly 
different to the previous study, in which estimations were 
made  in  relation  to  that  day  from  when  they  had  woken 
up. The control group did not receive any texts, but their 
SNS  usage  was  still  monitored  during  this  period.  The 
final set of questionnaires was then completed.

Questionnaire measures 
There  were  no  significant  changes  in  any  of  the

SNS use 
Actual  SNS  behavior  did  not  change  (Figure  4).  This 
figure  shows  data  for  the  ten  days  estimations  were 
elicited, as well as the days they were elicited for, which 
included  the  days  before  in  the  case  of  the  retrospective 
condition and the days after in the case of the prospective 
condition. This resulted in a total of 14 days. The number 
of  seconds  SNS  was  used  for  per  day  ranged  from  0  to 
17340 (4 hours and 49 minutes).  The average amount of 
time  spent  on  SNS  per  day  was  40.66  minutes,  and  this 
was similar across the groups.  

The  accuracy  of  estimations  also  did  not  change  during 
the  course  of  the  experiment  (Figure  5).  The  estimation 
error  ranged  from  0  to  357.58  seconds  (5  minutes  and 
37.58 seconds).  

 RescueTime  
The mean number of days RescueTime was accessed 
during the 13 days (including the days before after the 
estimation period to account for the retrospective and 
prospective estimations) was 2.93 (S.D.=12.03). This 
ranged from 0 to 12. The average amount of time spent 
on RescueTime per day was 4.68 seconds (S.D.=12.03),

The mean total of RescueTime use across the 13 days was 
60.9 (S.D.=156.43). There were no significant differences 
in RescueTime use across the different conditions. There 
were also no differences in any of the questionnaire

that 
retrospective  estimations  would  reduce  perceived  stress 
and  that  prospective  estimations  would  improve  time 
management  behaviours,  in  line  with  previous  research. 
Moreover,  both  estimation  types  were  expected  to  result 
in  improved  estimation  accuracy.  However,  neither 
estimation  type  was  found  to  have  any  effect  on  the 
questionnaire  measures,  the  accuracy  of  the  estimations, 
nor  actual  SNS  use,  despite  participants  being 
intrinsically and extrinsically motivated.  

This  result  was  unexpected,  as  potentially  influential 
factors  had  been  kept  consistent  with  Zhou  et  al  [16], 
including  the  measures  employed,  the  frequency  of 
estimation  requests  and  incentives  for  participation.  
Furthermore, the questions that had been raised following 
Study 1 had been addressed and potential issues with this 
study  were  corrected  in  this  instance,  for  example  the 
focus  on  undergraduate  students.  The  discrepancies  in 
results are therefore unclear.  

One  possible  explanation  is  the  fact  that participants  did 
not  engage  with  RescueTime.  The  amount  of  time  spent 
on  RescueTime  in  Study  1  was  substantially  lower  than 
that  observed  in  Zhou  et  al [16]  and  yet  the  accuracy  of 
(cid:83)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:76)(cid:83)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:86)(cid:182) (cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:80)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:86) (cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:79)(cid:79) (cid:76)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:71) (cid:68)(cid:86) (cid:68) (cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:88)(cid:79)(cid:87)(cid:17) In the 
present study, the level of engagement with RescueTime 

was  much  lower  still.  Some  participants  in  the  present 
study did not access RescueTime at all beyond the initial 
check  to  ensure  that  there  were  no  technical  issues,  and 
the  average  number  of  days  on  which  RescueTime  was 
visited  was  only  2.93,  compared  to  6.94  and  4.13  times 
observed in Zhou et al [16] and Study 1 respectively. This 
is  despite  participants  in  the  present  study  reporting 
similar or lower levels of satisfaction with their SNS use 
(4.03 out of 7, overall) compared to Zhou et al [16] (4.06) 
and Study 1 (4.42). 

It  had  been  assumed  that  the  estimation  task  would 
encourage participants to become interested in their actual 
SNS use and determine the accuracy of their estimates by 
using  RescueTime.  The  relatively  infrequent  use  of 
RescueTime in Study 1 was hypothesized to be due to the 
lower level of SNS use in the sample, motivating our use 
of undergraduate, rather than postgraduate, students in the 
current  study.  However,  even  with  similar  samples  who 
are  enthusiastic  users  of  SNS,  engagement  with 
RescueTime  cannot  be  guaranteed.  This  has  important 
implications; if completion of a task requiring the use of 
RescueTime  cannot  motivate  the  use  of  the  software  in 
purportedly  interested  participants,  it  raises  the  question 
of what might be preventing people using this PI tool. 

We  therefore  decided  to  carry  out  a  more  in  depth 
investigation  into  the  experience  of  RescueTime  users. 
We  hoped  this  would  help  our  interpretation  of  the  first 
two  studies,  and  more  broadly,  establish  whether  design 
or usability issues may prevent the information provided 
being useful.  

STUDY 3 

Introduction 
The findings of Study 1 and Study 2 indicated that asking 
participants  to  estimate  their  daily  SNS  usage  was  not 
to  ensure  participants  actually  accessed 
sufficient 
RescueTime  to  a  substantial  degree.  This  was  the  case 
across contact methods (phone or text) and student groups 

375

(postgraduates and undergraduates). The data collected as 
part of these studies alone could not provide information 
on the underlying reasons for the apparent lack of interest 
in  using  RescueTime.  This  is  not  only  an  issue  with  the 
present line of research but is widespread in the area of PI 
tools and therefore has broader implications for the use of 
PI  tools  in  real  life  situations;  there  can  be  a  lack  of 
engagement  with  PI  tools  [11],  even  when  there  is 
intrinsic  motivation  to  use  information  that  could  be 
provided  by  the  tools.  Consequently  it  was  important  to 
supplement these studies with a more in depth exploration 
of how RescueTime is used, interpreted and applied. This 
is in order to both  understand the results of the previous 
studies  and  also  gain  insight  into  what  could  be  done  to 
improve the experience of using RescueTime. 

We conducted an interview study, focusing on those who 
had installed RescueTime for the purpose of the study or 
previous 
the 
application.  The  interviews  aimed  to  identify  barriers  to 
engagement and explore if and how RescueTime leads to 
reflection and greater productivity.

Method 

Participants 
A  total  of  seven  participants  were  recruited  (four  of 
whom  were  female),  aged  25-40.  All  were  in  positions 
that required working on computers and juggling multiple 
tasks,  and  all  worked  within  a  university  setting.  This 
included  academics,  researchers,  professional  services 
staff and PhD students.  Three participants had previously 
installed RescueTime (one of whom as part of a previous 
experiment) and had been using the software for between 
three  months  and  a  year.  Four  others  responded  to  an 
advertisement  which  called  for  people  who  had  an 
interest in monitoring their productivity. 

Procedure 
Participants  were  asked  to  install  RescueTime  on  their 
devices  for  a  minimum  of  two  weeks  prior  to  the 
interviews.  However,  those  that  had  previously  used 
RescueTime  had  this  installed  for  a  longer  period,  some 
for  up  to  a  year.  Some  of  these  therefore  used  the  free 
version  of  the  software.  The  semi-structured  interviews 
took approximately 30-60 minutes.  

Results and Discussion 
Despite the participant group consisting of both long term 
and new users of RescueTime, no substantial differences 
were found between these groups in the data.   

A  thematic  analysis  was  used  to  analyse  the  interviews. 
Participants  reported  a  lack  engagement  with  the  data 
provided  by  the  tool.  This  corresponds  strongly  with  the 
finding  that  failure  to  maintain  interest  arose  from 
ineffective  feedback  outlined  in  Snow  et  al  [14].  We 
found  that  participants  did  find  some  utility  in  using 
RescueTime.  However,  there  were  four      barriers  that 
inhibited  engagement.  In  particular,  the  way  this  PI  tool 
presents  data  lacks:  salience;  contextual  information; 
credibility; and action advice. As a result the tool fails to 
initiate behaviour change. 

Utility

376

Participants  felt  that  RescueTime  failed  to  provide  them 
with  new  information  about  their  behaviour  reaffirmed 
what they already knew: âIt really did just confirm what I
already knew.
Iâm very productive in the morning and
then have a slump in the middle of the day and it picks up 
again towards the end, which I kind of knew already.â â
P5

This  seemed  to  mostly  be  the  case  for  information 
relating  to  periods  of  productivity  or  the  specific  hours 
worked:  âIt showed me that I mainly work on Monday,
Tuesday  and  Wednesday  and  then  sometimes  in  the 
evening during the rest of the weekâ¦ but I knew that!â â
P4

However,  when  it  came  to  more  detailed  information  on 
tasks  that  may  not  be  as  readily  monitored,  participants 
did  gain  new  insights.  This  was  particularly  the  case for 
e-mail use: âI realized that I spent less time on email than
I thought.  Frequent short glances feels like it adds up to 
a lot of time when it actually doesnât.â â P6

Barrier 1: Data Salience

them  with  an  overview  of 

As in Study 1 and Study 2, participants admitted to very 
rarely  accessing  the  website  to  view  their  data,  and 
instead  would  rely  on  their  weekly  summary  e-mail  to 
provide 
their  digital 
behaviours: âThat is the thing that reminds me I have RT
on  my  computer  and  then  I  might  go  and  look  at  my 
dashboard and have a look at my report and think âhm,
thatâs interestingâ âI pretty much forget I have RT
installedâ - P4 

This appeared to be partly due to the ease with which this 
information  was  accessed,  and  not  necessarily  because 
they  intended  to  seek  out  their  data:  âI looked at
it
because it came to me and I didnât have to proactively go
looking for RT data.  It was just there.â- P7

One  aspect  that  prevents  engagement  is  not  having 
immediate  access  to  the  data,  and  having  to  stop  any 
activity  currently  being  performed  in  order  to  seek  this 
information  out  on  the  website.  This  is  similar  to  the 
findings of Snow et al [14], in which energy meters were 
found to encourage greater engagement when the display 
was  readily  visible  rather  than  when  effort  was  required 
to  check  the  information.  This  indicates  that  one  way 
engagement could be improved is to make the data more 
readily  available,  and  not  only  accessible  through  the 
website.

Barrier 2: Contextual information 
The  lack  of  context  provided  by  the  tool  was  also 
problematic;  participants  found  it  difficult  to  gain  a  true 
understanding  of  their  work  patterns  from  the  data 
without contextual information relating to factors such as 
deadlines  or  working  hours:  âThe numbers themselves
donât really make much sense. You need activity of
whatâs going on side by side with it,
like tasks and
deadlines etc.â â P6 

This also applied to goals, as participants felt that aiming 
for specific amounts of times on applications rather than 
the  completion  of  tasks  was  not  helpful  in  motivating 
behaviour:  âYou donât go back home and say, âI should

do one more hour of Microsoft Wordâ, you go back  and
say, âI should finish that job by tomorrow.â
It may take
half the time, it may take twice â you just donât know.â â
P7

There  was  also  a  need  for  a  broader  context  in  terms  of 
how others are working. In particular, there was a limited 
understanding  of  what  the  productivity  pulse  actually 
meant, particularly in rela(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81) (cid:87)(cid:82) (cid:90)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:87) (cid:68) (cid:179)(cid:74)(cid:82)(cid:82)(cid:71)(cid:180) (cid:86)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:72) (cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:29)
âIâm not even sure what a productivity score really is. It
doesnât make any sense to me, Iâm not sure what I should
be aiming for.â â P6 

âThe most interesting would be seeing other people with
the  same  job  as  me  in  [the  university]  to  see  what  their 
data looks like. Just to see if they do it better.â â P5  

The  lack  of  opportunities  for  participants  to  reflect  on 
their data or access to some kind of social context for this 
information  meant  that  they  were  not  sure  whether  they 
should be happy with their score or be striving to improve 
it.  This  is  in  line  with  a  number  of  behaviour  change 
theories,  which  argue  that  social  norms  and  social 
influence  are  useful  for  creating  the  impetus  to  alter 
behaviour [12]. 

Barrier 3: Data Credibility 
Participants  tended  to  mistrust  the  data  or  believe  that  it 
was  not  a  true  representation  of  their  actual  activities: 
âItâs assuming that youâre doing all of your work at one
computer and thatâs all you do, but thatâs not the case.â â
P7

Even  when  completing  tasks  on  the  computer,  it  is 
possible  that  this  issue  may  also  be  present  when  tasks 
involve multiple applications. For instance, for situations 
in  which  dealing  with  e-mails 
involves  updating 
spreadsheets,  RescueTime  would  categorise  the  time 
spent  on  the  e-mail  application  as  separate  to  the  time 
spent  on  the  spreadsheet,  despite  the  two  applications 
being  used  for  the  same  purpose.  This  lack  of  trust  may 
be  a  further  barrier  to  engagement,  as  viewing  data  that 
indicates  much 
the 
lower  productivity 
participant believes to be true can be demotivating: âThe
numbers feel depressingly low. Youâll be working hard
all week and then get really low numbers because itâs not
logging meetings and travel time.â â P6

than  what 

Even  when  faced  with  a  score  they  believed  could  be 
lower  than  ideal,  the  lack  of  trust  in  the  validity  of  the 
data  meant  that  they  were  unlikely  to  use  this  as 
motivation to change their behaviour. 

Barrier 4: Action advice 
One  possible  barrier  to  RescueTime  being  useful  in 
encouraging  behaviour  change  is  that  even  when  new 
insights were gained from the data provided, participants 
were  not  sure  what  to  do  with  this  information:  âEven
though itâs good at
telling you whether  you  are
completing your time goal, itâs not quite allowing me to
reflect on why Iâm not meeting that goal.â â P2 

This seemed to be at least partly due to a lack of certainty 
in  what  kind  of  goals  to  be  setting:  âWhat should I be
spending my time doing?â â P4 

The  difficulty  in  interpreting  this  information  led  to 
participants  not  actively  accessing  their  data,  instead 
relying on the weekly summary e-mail: âThat is the thing
that  reminds  me  I  have  RT  on  my  computer  and  then  I 
might go and look at my dashboard and have a look at my 
report and think âhm, thatâs interestingâ. I pretty much
forget I have RT installedâ (cid:177) P4

Failure to promote behaviour change 
For  both  confirmations  of  existing  behaviour  and  new 
insights, participants used this information more to accept 
their current behaviour than to motivate efforts to change. 
(cid:55)(cid:75)(cid:76)(cid:86) (cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:88)(cid:79)(cid:71) (cid:69)(cid:72) (cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:70)(cid:85)(cid:76)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:71) (cid:68)(cid:86) (cid:68)(cid:81) (cid:179)(cid:68)(cid:70)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:83)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:70)(cid:72) (cid:72)(cid:83)(cid:76)(cid:83)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:92)(cid:180) (cid:62)(cid:25)(cid:64)(cid:15)
which  is  when  an  individual  becomes  aware  of  their 
behaviour  but  is  satisfied  with  it  and  therefore  not 
motivated  to  try  to  change  it.  This  appeared  to  apply  to 
both productive and unproductive activities: âIt made me
accept that the unproductive period just is what it is.â â
P5. 

Many  participants  consequently  did  not  feel  the  need  to 
(cid:88)(cid:86)(cid:72) (cid:53)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:70)(cid:88)(cid:72)(cid:55)(cid:76)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:182)(cid:86) (cid:74)(cid:82)(cid:68)(cid:79) (cid:73)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:88)(cid:85)(cid:72) (cid:76)(cid:81) (cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:85) (cid:87)(cid:82) (cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:87) (cid:87)hemselves 
targets.  Even  when  this  feature  was  utilised,  it  did  not 
seem  to  promote  actual  changes  in  behaviour  but  once 
again, led to acceptance epiphanies. This was irrespective 
of  how  achievable  the  goals  themselves  were:  âFrom
using  RescueTime  I  discovered  that  I  actually  tended  to 
spend less than an hour a day [on e-mails].  I considered 
changing the goal to spending less than 1 hour on emails, 
but then thought Iâll just keep it at 2 and then Iâll always
reach that goal.â â P2 

This  consequently  highlights  how  the  barriers  identified 
result in a lack of behaviour change.  

Limitations 
This  study  did,  however,  have  certain  limitations.  For 
instance,  some  of 
the  participants  had  only  used 
RescueTime for a two week period, which may not have 
been  adequate  to  assess  its  usefulness.  Participant  3,  for 
instance, had reported to be interested in the points during 
the day in which he got distracted, but that several more 
weeks  of  data  would  have  been  useful  in  trying  to 
establish these patterns. Moreover, one of the participants 
only  had  RescueTime  installed  due  to  their  involvement 
in  previous  studies  the  research  group  had  conducted. 
Although  this  is  unlikely  to  have  impacted  their  view  of 
(cid:53)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:70)(cid:88)(cid:72)(cid:55)(cid:76)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:182)(cid:86) (cid:88)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:73)(cid:88)(cid:79)(cid:81)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:86)(cid:15) (cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72) (cid:80)(cid:82)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:89)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81) (cid:73)(cid:82)(cid:85) (cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:68)(cid:74)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)
with  the  software  in  the  first  place  is  markedly  different 
to those seeking it out independently.  

However, despite these issues, the data confirm that those 
interviewed  were  not  readily  able  to  perceive  what  their 
data  meant,  nor  were  they  able  to  instantly  apply  this  to 
their  behaviour.  Although  this  is  interesting  in  its  own 
right, this is particularly relevant to the findings of Study 
1  and  Study  2,  in  which  a  lack  of  engagement  was  a 
substantial  problem.  Addressing  these  factors  in  the 
design  of  the  tool,  how  the  information  is displayed  and 
what  accompanying  advice  is  provided  may  assist 
developers in creating PI tools that facilitate engagement.

GENERAL DISCUSSION 
The  series  of  studies  outlined  in  this  paper  have 
demonstrated that engagement with RescueTime across a 
range  of  studies  is  low.    Despite  both  intrinsic  and 
extrinsic  motivation  to  engage  with  the  tool  in  order  to 
monitor  digital  behaviours,  specifically  time  spent  on 
SNS,  participants  experienced  a  number  of  barriers  to 
engagement.  This  was  evident  in  the  first  two  studies  in 
which  participants  spent  less  time  using  the  PI  tool  and 
checked 
in  previous 
less  frequently 
investigations,  despite  the  same  tasks,  incentives  and 
similar  levels  of  satisfaction  with  their  current  SNS  use. 
Especially  in  the  case  of  Study  2,  this  prevented  any 
benefits  of  using  RescueTime  being  evident,  as  SNS 
usage,  perceived  stress,  perception  of  time  management 
behaviours  and  estimation  accuracy  did  not  show  any 
change during the course of the experiment. Study 3 was 
able  to  explore  this  further  and  following  interviews  of 
new,  current  and  long  standing  users,  identified  four 
barriers  to  engagement  when  discussing  their  use  of 
RescueTime.  The  way  this  PI  tool  presents  data  lacks: 
salience;  contextual  information;  credibility;  and  action 
advice. Taken together, these findings indicate that there 
can  be  substantial  individual  differences  in  the  level  of 
engagement with PI systems, beyond those that would be 
immediately  obvious  (for  instance,  age  or  student  status, 
which  were  comparable  across  the  studies).  Moreover, 
simply  providing  participants  with  a  goal  setting  task  in 
the hope that this will be sufficient motivation to engage 
with  PI  systems  may  not  guarantee  they  will  actually  be 
used.  This  appears  to  be  true  regardless  of  intrinsic  and 
extrinsic motivation to change and observe SNS use. This 
is due to factors within the individual, but also the design 
of the tool itself, and how it presents the data.  

able 

to  make 

Our  work  was 
a  number  of 
recommendations in relation to the design of PI tools, and 
how they can be adapted to improve engagement.  Study 
3 identified that one of the main issues with RescueTime 
is  a  lack  of  direction;  information  is  presented,  often 
without explanation or context, and no advice, points for 
comparison  or  opportunities  for  reflection  are  provided. 
Although  many  of  these  factors  could  be  combatted  by 
altering  settings  or  actively  soliciting  information  from 
other users, the onus is on the individual to seek out this 
information and invest more time in tailoring the tools to 
their  preferences.  However,  especially  in  the  case  of 
productivity PI tools,  the most enthusiastic adopters will 
be those that already consider themselves to be time poor 
and will not be motivated to make these kinds of changes.

four  barriers 

The 
inhibit  engagement  with 
RescueTime  are  in  agreement  with  other  research  and 
appear to be an issue across a number of PI tools. Li, Dey 
and  Forlizzio  [12]  report  that  the  reflection  stage  of  PI 
tool  use  can  be  disrupted  by  a  lack  of  context  and  an 
inability  to  interpret  the  data.  Moreover,  the  next  stage, 
action, can be prevented by a lack of direction in what to 
do  next.  While  some  PI  tools  do  have  this  in-built 
capability, for those that do not, users are required to seek 

this kind of advice elsewhere, for instance, from a doctor 
for  guidance  on  the  output  of  fitness  related  apps. 
However,  in  the  case  of  SNS  use,  there  is  no  clear 
alternative  source  of  help,  and  it  is  therefore  likely  that 
RescueTime and similar PI tools leave many users unable 
to act on their information.  

The very short amount of time spent on the RescueTime 
website evident in Study 1 and Study 2 suggest a lack of 
time  or  motivation  for  seeking  out  this  information. 
Therefore, one design recommendation would be to lower 
the barrier for access to this information by improving the 
salience of the data. This approach has been supported by 
(cid:54)(cid:81)(cid:82)(cid:90) (cid:72)(cid:87) (cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:182)(cid:86) (cid:90)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:78) (cid:62)14],  which  identified  that  when  an 
energy monitor was hidden away from view, this resulted 
in greater disengagement as participants were required to 
invest  more  effort  into  remembering  to  check  the  meter 
and to locate it. Replicating this in manner similar to the 
wearable  activity  tracker,  Fitbit,  may  consequently  be  a 
positive influence on ease of use, as some models are able 
to  display  activity  measures.  This  means  that  users  are 
able  to  view  basic  data  without  having  to  even  open  a 
smartphone  application,  but  can  view  more  complex 
breakdowns  on  the  website  should  they  require  them. 
Although wearable devices are not necessarily a solution 
for a PI tool such as RescueTime, this could be emulated 
in  desktop  displays,  browser  windows  or  smartphone 
widgets.  However,  care  should  be  taken  to  insure  this 
information  is  not  made  too  visible  to  those  whom  the 
user  may  not  wish  to  see  it,  for  instance,  co-workers  as 
this  may  have  the  opposite  effect;  when  investigating 
water meters in the home, Froehlich et al [8] highlighted 
the need for some visibility, but also the knowledge that 
personal  information  would  not  be  made  available  to 
guests or other third parties.  

CONCLUSION 
One  might  expect  that  a  lack  of  engagement  would  be 
more of an issue with tools that aggregate measurements 
from a number of people, because the presented data are 
(cid:81)(cid:82)(cid:87) (cid:86)(cid:82)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:92) (cid:68) (cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:84)(cid:88)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:70)(cid:72) (cid:82)(cid:73) (cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:72) (cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:76)(cid:89)(cid:76)(cid:71)(cid:88)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:182)(cid:86) (cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:89)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:88)(cid:85)(cid:17)
However, our studies show that lack of engagement is as 
much  of  an  issue  for  tools  that  display  personal 
information,  such  as  RescueTime,  as  for  those  that 
display aggregated data, such as household electricity use 
measured  by  energy  monitors.  Our  studies  therefore 
support the findings of Snow et al [13] but in a different 
domain,  that of  PI  tools  for  productivity.  One  difference 
to Snow et al is that some of our participants did not even 
show an initial short term engagement with RescueTime, 
even 
intrinsic  and  extrinsic 
though  we  provided 
motivation for using the tool.  

We have identified four barriers to engagement that are a 
consequence  of 
the  way  RescueTime  presents 
information and can be addressed by design interventions: 

Salience:  Productivity  PI  tools  should  have  low  barriers 
to  data  access;  particularly  in  this  domain,  users  have 
limited time to spend on accessing and interpreting their 
data,  and  this  should  therefore  be  as  quick  to  access  as 
possible.  In  line  with  the  previously  noted  need  for 
visibility of displays [14], while maintaining privacy [8].

Contextual  information:  The  data  is  difficult  to  interpret 
without  some  indication  as  to  what  average  values  for 
similar  individuals  may  be  and  such  tools  should 
therefore  support  social  comparison.  Moreover,  greater 
support  for  integration  of  personal  contexts,  such  as 
schedules  and  deadlines,  would  make  the  data  more 
holistic.

Credibility:  Users  need  to  feel  that  the  data  is  accurate 
and believable for any action to be considered. This could 
be 
inclusion  of  contextual 
the 
information,  so  the  values  displayed  also  reflect  time 
away  from  the  computer.  However,  this  work  also 
highlights  that  users  have  inaccurate  perceptions  of  how 
much  time  they  spend  on  digital  tasks,  and  the  lack  of 
belief in the data  may stem  from this. Consequently, the 
design  needs  to  address  this  as  well,  perhaps  through 
providing verification tasks throughout the initial tutorial 
to prompt users to confirm or deny the collected data so 
far. This would highlight the data to be accurate and build 
a trusting relationship with the technology.  

Action advice: The tool needs to help users identify what 
further actions they may take. Study 3 highlighted that a 
sense  of  uncertainty  in  how  to  proceed  was  a  dominant 
(cid:73)(cid:68)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:85) (cid:76)(cid:81) (cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72) (cid:83)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:76)(cid:83)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:86)(cid:182) (cid:88)(cid:86)(cid:72) (cid:82)(cid:73) (cid:53)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:70)(cid:88)(cid:72)(cid:55)(cid:76)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:17) (cid:55)(cid:75)(cid:76)(cid:86) (cid:76)(cid:86) (cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:92)
much in line with more general research on PI tools [12], 
which suggests that even basic information on alternative 
sources  of  information  to  support  changes  in  behaviour 
may  be  sufficient.    For  example,  the  activity  application 
Runkeeper 
training 
access 
programmes that users can follow. Therefore, in a similar 
vein,  RescueTime  could 
suggest  achievable  and 
appropriate  goals  or  could  implement  other  behaviour 
change techniques into the tool. This could, for example, 
include  guidelines  in  reducing  time  spent  using  SNS  to 
three 5 minutes blocks per day.

There  are  clear  benefits  from  being  more  aware  of  how 
we  spend  our  time  including  a  reduction  in  perceived 
stress, an increase in the perception of time management 
skills and, more generally, an awareness of our most time 
consuming  activities.  However,  our  study  shows  that 
awareness  alone  is  not  sufficient  to  facilitate  behaviour 
change and that there are a number of barriers that inhibit 
people  from  engaging  with  RescueTime  (measured  by 
both frequency and duration of usage). These barriers are 
all  a  consequence  of  how  information  is  presented  to 
users  and  we  have  proposed  how  better  design  could
