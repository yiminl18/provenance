ABSTRACT
Past research has shown the benefits of food journaling in promot-
ing mindful eating and healthier food choices. However, the links
between journaling and healthy eating have not been thoroughly
examined. Beyond caloric restriction, do journalers consistently
and sufficiently consume healthful diets? How different are their
eating habits compared to those of average consumers who tend
to be less conscious about health? In this study, we analyze the
healthy eating behaviors of active food journalers using data from
MyFitnessPal. Surprisingly, our findings show that food journalers
do not eat as healthily as they should despite their proclivity to
health eating and their food choices resemble those of the general
populace. Furthermore, we find that the journaling duration is only
a marginal determinant of healthy eating outcomes and sociodemo-
graphic factors, such as gender and regions of residence, are much
more predictive of healthy food choices.

1 INTRODUCTION
Recent progress in mobile and wearable technologies has provided
individuals the means to routinely track data about themselves
for self-knowledge and improvement. This self-tracking practice
is also known as quantified self or personal informatics. In the do-
main of dietary self-monitoring, mobile food journal apps, such as
MyFitnessPal (MFP hereafter), are one of the most popular tracking
methods widely used by millions of people. Past research has sug-
gested that food journaling is an effective intervention in weight

loss programs [9]. The act of journaling helps create increased in-
the-moment awareness (mindfulness) and can encourage healthier
choices [13, 14]. Understanding how the journaling practice affects
eating behaviors may provide useful insights for the designs of
an effective population-wide health intervention. While there is
growing evidence supporting the critical role of food journals in
improving weight loss outcomes, little empirical work has been
done to investigate the broader impacts of the journaling practice
on the individuals’ healthy eating behaviors. Especially, more evi-
dence is needed to: (1) quantitatively compare long-term healthy
eating habits of food journalers with other behavioral baselines,
such as the general public and the dietary recommendations; and
(2) measure the influences of the journaling practice on the healthy
eating outcomes with respect to other factors. From a methodologi-
cal perspective, it is also an opportunity to further explore the use
of a large-scale self-tracking data in conjunction with offline data
sources to answer these questions.

To address the research gaps, our study aims to assess the healthy
eating behaviors of food journalers by analyzing public food diary
entries of MFP users and comparing their eating behaviors to those
of the general populace reported in other studies. Although people
tend not to perceive healthy eating the same ways as public-health
experts [5, 41], a recent survey [13] suggests that a vast number
of food journalers (past and present) generally agree with experts
about the notion of healthy eating, e.g., most believe that they
should eat more fruits and vegetables, lean meat, and balanced
diets. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that food journalers are
more likely to achieve evidence-based healthy eating outcomes, as
defined by public-health experts, than the average consumers who
may be less informed about healthy eating. Next, we expect active
food journalers, who are likely to develop a mindful eating habit, to
consciously make healthy food choices and be less influenced by the
sociodemographic biases. Specifically, we formulate the following
research questions:

RQ1: Do active food journalers have healthier eating behaviors

than the general populace?

To investigate the effectiveness of journaling in encouraging
healthier food choices, we aim to characterize the healthy eating
behaviors of food journalers using the corresponding intakes from
the dietary guidelines and the general populace as comparison data.
If food journalers tend to (1) have higher intakes of healthy diets
and lower intakes of unhealthy diets than the general populace
and (2) consistently meet the recommended intakes per the dietary
guidelines, then such findings may provide evidence supporting the
notion that not only does journaling is linked to significant weight
loss, but it also plays a significant role in individuals’ healthier food
choices.

Session: Information Recording & SeekingDH’18, April 23-26, 2018, Lyon, France35RQ2: How do the eating behaviors of food journalers significantly

differ across sociodemographic groups?

Mindless eating describes a situation where individuals are un-
aware of the influences exerted on their food choices by external
factors, such as the environment and gender roles. It is generally as-
sociated with unhealthy eating habits and weight gains [45]. Here,
we seek to further examine the relationship between the healthier
food choices effect of journaling and the healthy eating behaviors of
food journalers. Specifically, we expect food journalers of different
sociodemographic backgrounds (e.g., gender, age, etc.) to be equally
conscious of their food choices such that their healthy eating be-
havior is more homogeneous than that of the general populace. For
example, male and female journalers should consume a comparable
amount of fruits and vegetables. In other words, the difference in
fruit and vegetable intakes between male and female journalers
should not be statistically significant.

RQ3: To what extent does the journaling practice influence the

eating behaviors of food journalers?

Past research has shown that weight loss outcomes are propor-
tional to the journaling practice. That is, individuals who are more
active in recording their food journals tend to lose more weights
than the less active journalers [9]. As such, we aim to quantify
the impacts of journaling duration and persistence on the healthy
eating behaviors using regression analysis. If food journaling in fact
encourages healthier food choices and mindful eating, we expect
the journaling factors to have a higher influence on the eating be-
haviors than the sociodemographic factors. Such findings, together
with those from the other research questions, will help demonstrate
that food journaling is an effective healthy lifestyle intervention.
On the other hand, unexpected results may provide us insights
into the flaws of mobile food journals in affecting health behavior
changes.

The main contributions of our work are as follows. Firstly, we
thoroughly examine the relationship between food journaling, so-
ciodemographic factors, and a variety of healthy eating behaviors
in a large population of nearly 10,000 active food journalers over a
six-month period. Secondly, we present our data preprocessing steps
to automatically generate an analysis-ready dataset including: (1)
identifying relevant foods and beverages from the annotated food
diary entries; (2) extracting portion sizes of foods and beverages
from the food diary entry text and the associated caloric value; and
(3) normalizing the portion sizes of varying measurement units into
standard nutritional units. Lastly, our findings suggest, in contrast
to past studies, that the journaling duration only plays a minor
role in determining healthy eating behaviors, whereas several other
factors, such as gender, journaling persistence, and regions of resi-
dence, are much more influential in determining the healthy eating
behaviors than the journaling duration.

In what follows, we begin by reviewing related work on food
journaling and data-driven approaches to health behavior assess-
ment. Then, we introduce the healthy eating behaviors considered
in the study. Next, we describe the dataset and data preprocessing
steps. In the subsequent section, we define (1) the quantitative mea-
sures of the eating behaviors; and (2) the sociodemographic and
journaling factors being studied. Finally, we present the findings,
discuss their significance on the food journaling practice and future
design implications, and conclude the paper.

2 RELATED WORK
2.1 Personal informatics and food journaling
Much research in personal informatics has focused on characteriz-
ing the use of tools and technologies to track one’s own personal
data for self-discovery and behavior change in a variety of domains
[19, 41]. In particular, a few researchers have explored the use of
mobile food journals and other online tools for dietary self-tracking
in recent years [13, 14, 18]. Cordeiro et al. identified several key
challenges related to the journaling tools and practices, such as
unreliable data and negative nudges [14]. To overcome tracking
burden and promote mindful eating, Epstein et al. proposed a light-
weight food journal [18]. Recently, Chung et al. [11] studied the
practice of food tracking amongst Instagram users and the role of
social support on their healthy eating pursuit.

Our work is complementary to previous food journaling research
[13, 14, 18, 19]. While many studies aimed to qualitatively character-
ize various aspects of the self-tracking practices, few studies have
taken a computational approach to examine the broader impacts
of journaling on the healthy eating behaviors of food journalers.
In this study, we analyze more than 1 million food diary entries to
quantitatively assess the behavioral impacts of journaling.

2.2 Using online data to assess health behaviors
Data from online social media, quantified-self, and others have
been used to study various aspects of health behaviors. First, a few
studies [1, 15] analyzed mentions of foods in the Twitter network to
track major public health issues. Next, Park et al. [39] investigated
the impacts of user profile, fitness activity, and fitness network of
Twitter users on the long-term engagement of fitness app users.
Mejova et al. [31] analyzed food pictures shared by Instagram users
to study the prevalence of obesity. Recently, a few studies have
investigated the tasks of predicting diet compliance outcomes using
MFP food diary data [46] together with Twitter data [17].

Our work is highly relevant to [17, 46] in which the researchers
constructed computational models to predict diet compliance suc-
cess using different types of features, such as words & food types
identified from MFP diary entries and social and linguistic attributes
extracted from the users’ social media messages. While their studies
particularly focused on caloric balance as the primary outcome, we
examine a more comprehensive set of eating behaviors by using
evidence-based healthy eating outcomes as the primary measures.
Additionally, we investigate the role of sociodemographic and jour-
naling factors, derived from the user profile and food diary data, in
determining the healthy eating behaviors.

3 HEALTHY EATING BEHAVIORS
We begin by introducing the evidence-based healthy eating out-
comes categorized by the consumption of: (1) fruits and vegetables;
(2) animal-based protein sources, such as red and processed meat,
poultry, and fish; and (3) added sugars and sugary drinks. They
are identified based on growing scientific evidence from several
randomized controlled trials and meta-analysis about their asso-
ciations with health benefits and risks. Together, they constitute
dietary intakes commonly recommended by most dietary guidelines
[3, 20, 22, 36, 37, 47].

Session: Information Recording & SeekingDH’18, April 23-26, 2018, Lyon, France363.1 Fruits and vegetables
High intake of fruits and vegetables (abbreviated as FV) provides a
variety of long-term health benefits, such as lowering the risk of
cardiovascular disease [44] and cancers [30]. On the other hand, low
intakes of FV are associated with the increased prevalence of obesity
and diabetes [32]. Generally, a recommended daily FV intake for
healthy adults is at least 5 servings [32] or approximately 400 - 500
grams [22, 47]. Despite numerous health benefits, the consumption
of fruits and vegetables has been persistently low in the US [6] and
worldwide [47] for decades. From 1994 - 2005, the average daily
FV intake amongst Americans has decreased slightly from 3.43
servings to 3.24 servings while the percentage of people who met
the recommended daily intake has remained unchanged at about
25% [6]. In 2015, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) reported that less than 15% of Americans sufficiently met
the recommendations [22].

3.2 Red and processed meat, poultry, and fish
Growing evidence suggests that processed meat is carcinogenic
while red meat is probably carcinogenic [30]. High consumption
of red and processed meat may increase mortality rates of type-2
diabetes [4], cardiovascular disease [42] and colorectal cancer [30].
Replacing red and processed meat with healthier protein sources
such as white meat (e.g., poultry and fish) [2] may lower the risk
of all-cause mortality. Most dietary guidelines recommend to limit
a daily intake of red and processed meat to 1 serving or approxi-
mately 65 - 75 grams [20]. Despite high associations with various
health risks, red and processed meat still accounts for more than
50% of meat consumed in the United States with almost 2.31 serv-
ings per day [16]. Moreover, the consumption of healthier white
meat, such as fish, amongst Americans is low. On average, most
adults consumed 0.17 servings (17.28 grams) of fish a day [38],
70.59% lower than the recommended daily intake of 0.29 servings
(28.57 grams) [3].

3.3 Added sugars and sugary drinks
Added sugars are sugars not naturally occurring in foods and bev-
erages. Asides from sweetening and adding extra calories, they pro-
vide no nutritional benefits. Sugary drinks (e.g., sodas/soft drinks,
energy drinks, coffee drinks, and fruit juices) are the largest source
(36%) of added sugar intake in American diets [35]. According to
the recent survey by Gallup [24], 48% of Americans drink at least 1
glass of soft drink on an average day. Ideally, sugary drink consump-
tion should be avoided at all cost; or else an intake should be limited
to 237 milliliters a day [36]. There is strong evidence linking high
consumption of added sugars and sugary drinks to increased risks
for obesity and type-2 diabetes, whereas simply lowering the intake
of sugary drinks can reduce weight gain and decrease prevalence
of obesity [27]. Recent dietary guidelines suggest a maximum daily
intake of added sugars to 25 grams [37]. However, an American
adult consumes on average 70 grams [21] of added sugar per day,
180% higher than the recommended amount.

4 DATA
4.1 Collecting and processing MFP data
We used a public food diary dataset1 collected from 9,896 MFP
users in March 2015 by Weber and Achananuparp [46]. The dataset
includes 71,715 unique food entries recorded over 1,919,024 meals
from a 6-month recording period between October 2014 to March
2015. Each user recorded 59.3 days of diaries on average (S.D. =
54.6, median = 42). The majority of users were able to achieve
their daily caloric goals [46]. Users who recorded at least 7 days
of diary entries were treated as active users (N=8,381; 85.69% of
all users in the dataset). Each food diary text was automatically
annotated with categorical information describing its composition
(e.g., food groups) and cooking method in the previous work [46].
In addition, basic nutritional facts (e.g., calories, protein, sugar) for
each food entry were available. Next, we performed data cleaning
by removing 207 outlying diary entries (0.04% of total data) whose
total daily calories are: (1) greater than 6,000 kcal or 2 standard
deviations away from the mean daily calories; or (2) lower than or
equal to zero kcal.

For each user in the dataset, we further collected personal infor-
mation from their user profile page. In total, the profile pages of
8,794 users are publicly accessible. Next, we categorized the profile
attributes such as age, geographical location, and friend list into
the following groups: Age group (young adults age 18-44 years old
and old adults age 45 and above), social connection quartiles (Q1:
0-6 friends, Q2: 7-18 friends, Q3: 19-41 friends, and Q4: 42 or more
friends), regions of residence at a global level (US and Non-US),
and regions of residence within the United States as per the US
census classification (Northeast, South, Midwest, and West). As we
can see in Table 1, the majority of users are female (82.01%) and
young adults 18 - 44 of age (79.80%). Next, more than 50% of users
have less than 19 users in their friend list. Most users reside in the
United States (70.88%) while the rest of the users live outside the
US. Amongst US users, 33.76% live in the Southern states, whereas
18.37% live in the Northeastern states. The geographical distribu-
tion of MFP users is representative of the population distribution
across US regions [8].

4.2 Normalizing and extracting portion sizes
Each diary entry contains a free-text description of the food item
(i.e., name and portion size) and nutritional facts, such as calories,
protein, sugar. When recording a diary entry, MFP users can choose
to enter the amount of food and beverage in various measurement
units. For example, the measurement units for apple may include
weights (grams, ounces, pounds, and kilograms), volumes (cup),
physical sizes (small, medium, and large), and nutritional units
(servings). To make it possible to directly compare the dietary in-
takes, we apply the following steps to normalize the portion sizes.
First, we extracted quantity and unit from the diary entry text using
regular expressions and convert weights and volumes from other
measurement systems to grams and milliliters, respectively. Then,
we used the annotated categories to identify specific types of diets.
First, for solid foods containing only a category of fruit, vegetable,
red meat, poultry, or fish, we determined standard serving sizes
using the conversions [23] in Table 2. For example, 100 grams of
apple is equal to 0.67 serving of fruit. If a gram-equivalent weight
cannot be found in the diary entry text, the amount of correspond-
ing calories in the diary entry was used for the conversion instead.
E.g., a 320-kcal tuna contains 2 servings of fish. Next, for composite
foods typically served with grains and other types of ingredients,
we subtract 240 (an average kcal for 1 regular serving of grain-based
foods) from the total calories and calculate the serving sizes using
the corresponding caloric values in Table 2. With these steps, we
can identify 1 serving of fish from a 400-kcal tuna sandwich.

4.3 Caloric intake patterns
Figure 1 displays the average daily caloric intakes over time. Over-
all, the average daily caloric intakes, as seen in Figure 1(a) are
around 1,700 kcal and 1,300 kcal for male and female users, respec-
tively. As expected, these are much lower than the estimated calorie
requirements of an average adult (2,000 - 2,200 kcal), suggesting
that the users were likely dieting. Furthermore, we observe the
largest interquartile range of the daily caloric intakes in Decem-
ber, followed by the smallest in January, a possible effect of a new
year’s weight-loss resolution. Lastly, we compare the daily calo-
rie intakes between weekdays in Figure 1(b). As can be seen, the
daily caloric intakes follow the weekday-weekend lifestyle pattern,
trending slightly upward from Monday before reaching the largest
interquartile range on Saturday.

5 METHODS
5.1 Behavioral measures
Based on the eating behaviors introduced previously, we define the
following measures to quantify the behavioral outcomes for each
MFP user:

(a) Caloric intake by month

(b) Caloric intake by weekday

Figure 1: Average daily caloric intakes over time (kcal)

Journaling behaviors: Two journaling behaviors are defined
to represent the journaling duration and persistence. First, recording
days is defined as a number of days the user records food diary
entries. Second, normalized lapsing frequency is defined as a fraction
of days the user temporarily stops recording any diary entries with
respect to her journaling lifetime (recording days + lapsing days).
Eating behaviors: To measure the energy intake from foods and
beverages, we compute median daily caloric intake (in kcal). Next,
for each diet type, we compute median daily intake (in servings for
foods, grams for added sugars, and milliliters for drinks) and normal-
ized intake frequency (% of days in which the diets were consumed).
We used the following criteria to identify specific diet types from
the annotated food diary entries. First, fruits and vegetables are se-
lected from entries tagged with fruit and vegetable categories. Next,
red and processed meats are chosen from entries tagged with beef,
pork, lamb, game (meat from wild animals), sausage, and meatball
sub-categories. Furthermore, poultry and fish are identified from
entries tagged with poultry and fish sub-categories, respectively.
Next, added sugars are non-zero sugar content entries tagged with
the following categories and sub-categories: beverage, dessert, snack,
condiment, and dairy product. Lastly, sugary drinks include any non-
zero sugar content entries tagged with beverage category, whereas
soft drinks included entries tagged with soft drink subcategory. This
results in 14 diet-specific behavioral measures.

5.2 Sociodemographic and journaling factors
Now, we introduce the following factors known to be associated
with specific healthy eating behaviors below.

Gender and age: Gender and age have been found as contrib-
utors of behavioral differences in many dietary behavior studies.
For example, women tended to to eat more healthy diets than men,
e.g., consuming more fruits and fiber [6]. High consumption of
meat and red meat was closely associated with being male [16, 25].
Men also consumed more sugary drinks than women [7]. Next, as
people get older, they tended to eat less and changed their eating
behaviors. For instance, compared to younger adults, older adults
were more likely to consume more fruits and vegetables [6], less red
meat as well as all meat [16, 25] but more fish [16], and less sugary
drink [7]. In the mean time, younger adults tended to consume
more poultry [16]. In this work, we investigate (1) the behavioral
differences between genders (male and female), age groups (young
and old adults) in RQ2 and (2) the influences of the gender and age
factors on all behavioral measures in RQ3.

Social connections: Social ties have shown to have both the
positive and negative influences on health behaviors [43]. For in-
stance, daily consumption of fruits and vegetables [34] and overall
weight loss [28] were associated with high levels of social support.
However, having obese friends substantially increased one’s own
risk of obesity [10]. In this study, we explore (1) the behavioral
differences between social connection quartiles in RQ2 and (3) the
influence of social connections on all behavioral measures in RQ3.
Regions of residence: Differences in eating behaviors were
observed amongst Americans in different regions, which could be
attributed to social norms and environmental contexts. People in
the Northeast and the West were more likely to consume more
fruits and vegetables than those in the Midwest and the South [6].
Next, beef consumption was highest in Midwest and lowest in the
South [25]. In addition, people in the Midwest and the Northeast
consumed more sugary drinks than those in the South and the West
[40]. Particularly, the consumption of soft drinks was the highest
in the Northeast, compared to other regions [40]. In this work, we
examine (1) the behavioral differences between regions of residence
within the United States (Northeast, South, Midwest, and West) as
well as global regions of residence (US vs. non-US) in RQ2 and (2)
their influences on all behavioral measures in RQ3.

Journaling: Food journaling can promote mindful eating [13],
leading to weight loss [26], and healthier behaviors [18]. Further-
more, the health benefits were greater amongst highly active jour-
nalers [9]. In this work, we explore the influence of the journaling
behaviors, i.e., recording days and lapsing frequency, on all caloric
and diet-specific behavioral measures in RQ3.

6 RESULTS
6.1 RQ1: Distributions of the healthy diet

intakes

We first examine the average daily intake and the intake frequency
of each diet type over the 6-month period. For each food type, we
calculated the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the mean
daily servings and the percentage of days consumed for each user.
All CDF plots are shown in Figure 2.

Fruits and vegetables: As shown in Figure 2(a), most food jour-
nalers do not consume a sufficient amount of fruits and vegetables
on a daily basis. Especially, the average daily FV intake of food
journalers is much lower than that of the general populace. In par-
ticular, 50% of users consume up to 1.97 servings of FV per day,
whereas only 2.18% of users (N=183) manage to meet the recom-
mended daily intake of 5 servings. In terms of the frequency of
intake, shown in Figure 2(e), 50% of users consume fruits and veg-
etables up to 64.96% of the time. Furthermore, less than 1% of users
(N=6) are able to meet the recommended intake at least 80% of the
time. This is very surprising since fruits and vegetables should be
an essential part of any healthy diets, particularly amongst people
trying to lose weight and live a healthier lifestyle.

Red and processed meat, poultry, fish: Unlike typical Ameri-
can consumers, food journalers consume higher portions of healthy
protein sources, especially poultry, than unhealthy red and pro-
cessed meat. As shown in Figure 2(b), 50% of users consume up
to 0.53 servings of red and processed meat and 0.72 servings of
poultry per day. Moreover, the average intakes are within the rec-
ommended daily limit of 2 servings. Next, poultry is also consumed
more frequently than red and processed meat. According to Figure
2(f), 50% of users consume red meat and poultry up to 26% and 36%
of the time, respectively. However, the average daily fish intake is
much lower than that of other protein sources. Similar to average
consumers, food journalers consume much fewer servings of fish
per day than the recommended daily intake. Particularly, 50% of
users consume 0.09 servings of fish a day, whereas only 15% of
users (N=1,444) meet the recommendation as shown in Figure 2(b).
Added sugar and sugary drinks: The average daily added
sugar intake amongst food journalers is much lower than that
of the general populace. According to Figure 2(c), 50% of users
consume up to 16 grams of added sugar per day. However, the
top 25% of users consume higher amount of daily added sugar
intake (29.83 grams) than the recommended limits. Furthermore,
the consumption occurs very frequently. As shown in Figure 2(g),
50% of users consume added sugars up to 83% of the time, whereas
the consumption within the recommended limit only accounts for
up to 30% of the time. Next, the overall consumption of sugary

drinks and soft drinks amongst food journalers is comparable to
that of the general populace. As shown in Figure 2(d), 53.25% and
60.66% of users do not consume any sugary/soft drinks, respectively.
Amongst drinkers, the average daily intakes for both sugary and
soft drinks are less than 1 glass. However, on any drinking days,
the daily intake exceeds the limit most of the time.

Key insights: Unexpectedly, we find that the healthy eating
behaviors of active food journalers do not differ much from those
of the general populace in several areas. Given that our population is
highly skewed toward females, who tend to be health-conscious, the
numbers of healthy eating lapses observed are even more surprising.
For example, a vast majority of food journalers did not eat enough
fruits and vegetables and fish as per the dietary guidelines. Next,
their sugary and soft drink consumption was about the same level
as the general populace, which is a worrying trend. On a positive
note, the consumption of red and processed meat and added sugars
is lower in food journalers than the general populace.

6.2 RQ2: Behavioral differences
In this section, we present the differences in eating behaviors of
food journalers across sociodemographic groups. Comparisons of
behavioral measures, shown in Table 3, were performed by (1)
Mann-Whitney U test for genders, age groups, and global regions;
and (2) Kruskal-Wallis H test for social connections and US regions.
Dunn’s multiple comparisons, shown in Table 4, were performed
for social connections and US regions for post-hoc tests.

Journaling and caloric intakes: First, significantly higher me-
dian recording days are observed amongst the following groups
than other groups: males (p<0.01), older adults (p<0.01), largest
social connections (p<0.01), residing in the Northeast (p<0.01), and
residing outside the US (p<0.05) as shown in Table 3; pairwise differ-
ences are significant for all social connection pairs and the median

recording days of the Northeast and the Midwest are significantly
higher than that of the South as displayed in Table 4. Second, me-
dian lapsing frequency are significantly higher amongst users in the
following groups: females (p<0.01), younger adults (0.01), and small
connections (0.01); pairwise differences are significant between
smaller social connections (Q1, Q2, and Q3) vs. the largest (Q4).
Significantly higher median caloric intakes are observed amongst
the following groups than other groups: males (p<0.01), younger
adults (p<0.05), largest social connections (p<0.01), and residing
outside the US (p<0.01); pairwise differences are significant between
smaller social connections (Q1, Q2, and Q3) vs. the largest (Q4).

Fruits and vegetables: Compared to the general populace, the
differences in FV consumption of food journalers are associated
with similar sociodemographic groups (gender, social connections,
and regions of residence). First, females consume fruits and vegeta-
bles more frequently than males (p<0.01). Though, unlike the gen-
eral populace, males have a significantly higher median FV intake
(p<0.01). Next, the differences in FV intake and intake frequency
are significant between groups with different social connections
(p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively); pairwise differences are signifi-
cant between (Q2 vs. Q4) for FV intake and (Q1 vs. Q4), (Q2 vs. Q3),
and (Q2 vs. Q4) for intake frequency. Moreover, significantly higher
median FV intake and frequency are observed amongst those in
the West (p<0.01); pairwise intake differences are significant be-
tween (South vs. West) and (Midwest vs. West), whereas pairwise
frequency differences are significant between all region pairs except
(Northeast vs. West) and (South vs. Midwest). In contrast to the
general populace, there are no behavioral differences between age
groups for FV consumption.

Red and processed meat, poultry, fish: Similar to the general
populace, the differences in meat consumption amongst the MFP
populace are associated with gender, age, and regions of residence.

Caloric intake is in kcal. Food intakes are in numbers of servings. Sugar intake is in grams. Drink intakes are in mL. Intake frequencies are in percentages of days.
Intercept terms are omitted. Significance thresholds are * p<0.05 and ** p<0.01.

First, males have a significantly higher median intake (p<0.01) and
frequency (p<0.01) than females, for all protein sources except fish.
Second, older adults have a significantly higher fish intake fre-
quency (p<0.01). In addition, poultry consumption (median intake
and frequency) in younger adults is significantly higher (p<0.01).
Next, differences in red and processed meat intake frequency are sig-
nificant amongst regions of residence (p<0.01). Users in the Midwest
generally have the highest intake and intake frequency; pairwise
intake differences are significant between (Northeast vs. South)
and (Northeast vs. Midwest), whereas pairwise frequency differ-
ences are significant between the followings: (Northeast vs. South),
(Northeast vs. Midwest), and (Northeast vs. West). As opposed to
the general populace, older adults have a significantly higher me-
dian red and processed meat intake (p<0.01) and frequency (p<0.01)
than younger adults.

Added sugars and sugary drinks: Lastly, the differences in
added sugar and sugary drink consumption of food journalers are
associated with gender, age, and regions of residence – reflecting
the overall differences in the general populace. First, males have
a significantly higher median intake of soft drink (p<0.01) than
females; however, in contrast to the general populace, females have
significantly higher intake frequencies of added sugars (p<0.01)
and sugary drink (p<0.05). Second, the median intake of added
sugars is significantly higher in younger adults (p<0.05). Further-
more, younger adults have significantly higher intake frequencies
of sugary drinks (p<0.01) and soft drinks (p<0.01), than older adults.
In contrast to the general populace, we find that food journalers
in the Midwest and the South tend to consume more soft drinks
than those in the Northeast and the West. Specifically, users in
the Midwest have a significantly higher median soft drink intake
(p<0.05), whereas those in the South have a significantly higher

soft drink intake frequency (p<0.01) than other regions; pairwise
differences are significant for the South vs. other regions for the soft
drink intake frequency, whereas there are no pairwise differences
between regions for the median soft drink intake.

Key insights: Overall, food journalers who are male, 45 years
or older, and have the largest social network tend to have signifi-
cantly longer journaling duration and more persistent in recording
food journals than others. Next, the healthy eating behaviors of
food journalers within the sociodemographic groups are not as
homogeneous as we initially expected. As can be seen in Table 3,
58 of 85 (68%) behavioral differences are statistically significant.
Furthermore, the differences in eating behaviors across sociodemo-
graphic groups are, in many cases, fairly similar to those naturally
observable in the general populace. Specifically, both positive and
negative eating behaviors occurred within the expected sociodemo-
graphic groups, e.g., high intake frequency of fruits and vegetables
in females, high added sugar intake in younger adults, and more
healthy eating behaviors in users with larger social connections,
etc. The results are quite interesting as they may suggest that food
journalers were not being as mindful of their healthier food choices
as they should have been. We will further investigate the influences
of sociodemographic and journaling factors in the next section.

6.3 RQ3: Factors influencing eating behaviors
Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression was used to assess (1) the
influences of sociodemographic factors on the journaling behaviors
and (2) the influences of sociodemographic and journaling factors
on the caloric and diet-based behavioral measures. To that end,
we built 17 regression models in which each predicted variable
corresponds to each behavioral measure. For predictor variables,
we included gender (dummy coded 1 for male and 0 for female), age,

Session: Information Recording & SeekingDH’18, April 23-26, 2018, Lyon, France41social connections (logarithmic scale), US region (dummy coded
into 3 variables using Midwest as a reference category), global
region (dummy coded 1 for non-US and 0 for US), recording days,
and lapsing frequency.

Table 5 displays the predictor variables and their coefficients (β)
from 17 OLS regression models. The values of adjusted R2 of all
the models vary from 0.002 - 0.219, which are fairly low. As the
predicted variables are derived from a long-term (up to 6 months)
consumption data, we expect the predictors of the regression models
to modestly explain a small portion of variance of the predicted
variables as they do not take into account the temporal variability
of the behaviors. This also points to the fact that there are many
other factors which could potentially influence these behaviors. In
what follows, we summarize the influences of different factors on
all behaviors in the order of importance (by absolute coefficient
values and total number of behavioral measures influenced).

Gender: Overall, gender appears to be the most important factor
in influencing most of the behaviors in the study. Being male will
substantially change the value of most behavioral measures com-
pared to being female after controlling for other variables. Specifi-
cally, gender significantly influences 14 of 17 different behavioral
measures. Amongst all predictor variables, gender has the highest
predictive power on 7 behavioral measures, such as recording days,
lapsing frequency, and caloric intake, and the relatively high predic-
tive power (the top-3 highest coefficients) on 7 other measures, such
as FV intake, FV intake frequency, and poultry intake frequency.
Lapsing frequency: Next, lapsing frequency is the second most
influential factor of eating behaviors after gender. Specifically, it has
a relatively high predictive power on 10 behavior measures, such
as caloric intake, FV intake, and FV intake frequency. Interestingly,
it has adverse relationships with most eating behaviors as indicated
by negative coefficients β. In some cases, the negative relationships
seem counter-intuitive, e.g., an increase in lapsing frequency de-
creases median caloric intake and intakes of unhealthy diets. This
could be partially explained by the fact that some food journalers
may be more incline to record less and less diary entries before
they temporarily stop journaling [46]. For some, this may positively
indicate that they have already achieved their self-tracking goals
– an example of successful abandonment [12]. In a recent study,
De Choudhury et al. [17] concluded that this phenomenon should
not be common and long-term food journalers are more likely to
complete their diary entries when they choose to record a journal.
Regions of residence: Regions of residence have a substantial
influence on journaling and eating behaviors, particularly global
regions (US vs. Non-US). After adjusting for other factors, being
outside the US will considerably affect most behavioral measures
compared to being in the US. 13 of 17 behavioral measures are signif-
icantly influenced by global regions. Furthermore, it has a relatively
high predictive power on 12 behavioral measures, such as caloric
intake, FV intake, and FV intake frequency. More importantly, it is
one of the two significant predictors of fish intake. Next, US regions
of residence (Northeast, South, and West) significantly influence
10 of 17 behavioral measures. Amongst the behavioral measures,
it is a relatively high predictor of red and processed meat intake
(Northeast), red and processed meat intake frequency (Northeast),
sugary drink intake (Northeast), recording days (South), red and
processed meat intake (South), poultry intake (South), sugar drink

intake (South), soft drink intake frequency (South), and soft drink
intake (West).

Age: Age is not as predictive of the healthy eating and journaling
behaviors as gender, lapsing frequency, and regions of residence.
Even though 13 of 17 behaviors are influenced by age, its effects (β)
on these behaviors are fairly modest compared to many predictor
variables. For example, a one year increase in age will increase
the median red and processed meat intake by 0.004 servings after
adjusting for other variables.

Recording days: Recording days is one of the least predictive
factors of most dietary behaviors. A one day increase in recording
days will marginally change most behavioral measures after con-
trolling for other factors. Only half of the behavioral measures (8
of 16) are significantly influenced by recording days. In addition,
it is the second worst predictor of 7 influenced measures, such as
caloric intake, FV intake frequency, and red and processed meat
intake. Interestingly, it is one of the two significant predictors of
fish intake.

Social connections: Interestingly, social connection seems to
be the least influential factor of most behavioral measures. That is, it
has the least predictive power on 10 influenced behavior measures,
such as recording days, lapsing frequency, and caloric intake. For
instance, a 1% increase in social connections will only increase the
number of recording days by 0.007725 days after adjusting for other
factors.

Key insights: Between the two journaling factors considered in
this study, journaling persistence is more predictive of the healthy
eating behaviors than journaling duration. Moreover, the journal-
ing duration is one of the least influential factors of behaviors
compared to other sociodemographic factors. More importantly,
many sociodemographic factors, especially gender and regions of
residence, still play a more critical role in determining the healthy
eating behaviors of food journalers than the journaling factors. Con-
trary to its contribution in the weight loss outcomes, the results
show that the journaling duration is a marginal determinant of the
healthy eating behaviors.

7 DISCUSSION
Millions of people use mobile food journals as a tool for tracking
their caloric intake in order to achieve specific health goals, such
as losing weight and living a healthy lifestyle. Prior findings have
shown that food journals who actively record what they ate tend
to meet their caloric goals [17, 46] and lose more weights [9]. How-
ever, beyond managing caloric intake and weight, we found several
lapses in the food journalers’ healthy eating behaviors, e.g., low con-
sumption of fruits and vegetables and fish, and high consumption
of sugary drinks and soft drinks, preventing them from fully achiev-
ing their healthy lifestyle goal. Compared to the sociodemographic
factors, the journaling duration has the least amount of influence on
most eating behaviors. Most journalers’ healthier food choices are
significantly influenced by their gender roles and environmental
contexts, suggesting that their food choices are still largely subcon-
scious [45]. Overall, our study helps to further investigate the claim
about the journaling effect on healthier food choices [13, 14, 18]
using a large-scale data. From the public health perspective, we find
that their effectiveness in helping people achieve healthy eating

Session: Information Recording & SeekingDH’18, April 23-26, 2018, Lyon, France42behaviors as defined by evidence-based outcomes are marginal at
best. Based on our findings, it appears that the calorie counting
aspect of food journals is not sufficient and potentially unhelpful
in facilitating sustained health behavior change. By exclusively
focusing on caloric and weight control, food journals may uninten-
tionally mislead individuals into pursuing caloric management as
the only health goal and disregarding the physiological and meta-
bolic effects of different types of diets on health and well-being.
Our study also confirms findings from past study [13], suggesting
that there exists a mismatch between food journalers’ preconceived
notions of health eating and the energy-centric design of mobile
food journals, inadvertently leading to negative nudges.

Our findings have several implications to the designs of mobile
food journals or other forms of mHealth (mobile health) interven-
tions that can better facilitate healthy eating behaviors. First, from
the goal setting perspective [33], a variety of behavioral goals could
be suggested or posed as daily food challenges [18] to individuals
by learning from their past food journal data. The aim is to: (1)
supplement the existing caloric and nutrient intake goals; (2) pro-
vide a well-defined and quantifiable steps to help people achieve
the healthy lifestyle goals, such as high daily FV intake; and (3)
improve behavioral compliance and self-efficacy. Next, the goal-
setting mechanism could incorporate individuals’ backgrounds and
experiences such that the behavioral goals could be dynamically
and incrementally adjusted to suit them. Next, the goal-setting
mechanism could be designed to focus more on targeting whole
food consumption (e.g., consuming at least 5 servings of fruits and
vegetables a day) than isolated nutrients and constituents (e.g.,
consuming at least 30 grams of fiber per day). This could effectively
help educate individuals about the importance of food synergy and
promote the idea of dietary variety [29]. Lastly, behavioral interven-
tions tailored to individuals’ sociodemographic backgrounds could
be introduced to mobile food journals. The aim is to identify individ-
uals who are highly susceptible to certain eating behavior lapses and
provide them with additional guidance and actions relevant to their
current goals. For instance, male users, who are relatively prone
to infrequent fruit and vegetable consumption, could receive more
targeted notification messages designed to remind and persuade
them to meet their FV goals. Additionally, other complementary
sources of data, e.g., social media [17], could be included to improve
the adaptability and effectiveness of the interventions.

7.1 Limitations
Due to the self-reported and user-contributed natures of data, it is
difficult to verify the accuracy of the MFP data [14, 17, 46]. These is-
sues could bias the estimations of portion sizes and nutrient intakes
for various diet types, especially high-sugar diets which can be
deliberately omitted due to guilt [14]. Next, external data about the
dietary consumption of the general populace are generally collected
through traditional dietary assessment instruments, such as a Food
Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), which are more susceptible to re-
call bias than daily food journals. Higher prices of healthier food
choices, such as fish, may also affect the healthy eating patterns.
Moreover, since it is not possible to control for food journalers’
personal belief and perception about food and nutrition from the
MFP data, the effects (or lack thereof) of the journaling practice

may be confounded by the differences in healthy eating perception.
Although most journalers generally hold the views of healthy eat-
ing which are consistent with evidence-based recommendations
[13], some may choose to follow a specific dietary regimen, e.g.,
vegetarian diet, ketogenic diet, etc., for various reasons. Neverthe-
less, by allowing some noise in the data, our findings can be fairly
compared to epidemiological studies’. Lastly, since our findings are
obtained from online observational data, therefore they are limited
in determining the causal associations between sociodemographic
and journaling factors and healthy eating behaviors.

8 CONCLUSION
In this study, we investigated the healthy eating behaviors of My-
FitnessPal food journalers. Despite the claim about the benefit of
journaling in promoting healthier choices, we found that most food
journalers did not eat more healthful diets than the general public.
First, much of their dietary consumption did not meet the daily
recommended intakes of healthy and unhealthy food sources. Next,
their dietary patterns were not as uniform as we initially expected
and the distinct patterns mostly resembled those of the general
populace who may be less health conscious. Moreover, journal-
ing duration, which was previously shown to be associated with
improved weight loss outcomes, appeared to have a marginal in-
fluence on the healthy eating behaviors, whereas gender, lapsing
frequency, and regions of residence are much more predictive of
the healthy eating outcomes.
