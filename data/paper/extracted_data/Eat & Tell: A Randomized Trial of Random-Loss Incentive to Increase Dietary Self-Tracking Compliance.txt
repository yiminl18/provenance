ABSTRACT
A growing body of evidence has shown that incorporating behav-
ioral economics principles into the design of financial incentive
programs helps improve their cost-effectiveness, promote individ-
uals’ short-term engagement, and increase compliance in health
behavior interventions. Yet, their effects on long-term engagement
have not been fully examined. In study designs where repeated
administration of incentives is required to ensure the regularity of
behaviors, the effectiveness of subsequent incentives may decrease
as a result of the law of diminishing marginal utility. In this paper,
we introduce random-loss incentive – a new financial incentive
based on loss aversion and unpredictability principles – to address
the problem of individuals’ growing insensitivity to repeated in-
terventions over time. We evaluate the new incentive design by
conducting a randomized controlled trial to measure the influences
of random losses on participants’ dietary self-tracking and self-
reporting compliance using a mobile web application called Eat &
Tell. The results show that random losses are significantly more
effective than fixed losses in encouraging long-term engagement.

1 INTRODUCTION
Persistent collection of individuals’ lifestyle and behavior data is
instrumental in realizing precision medicine’s visions of providing
treatments and healthcare specifically tailored to individuals [7].
Recent advances in mobile sensors, wearable technologies, and
applications (also known as apps) have greatly facilitated active
and passive self-tracking of a wide range of individual behaviors,
including physical activities, sleep, and dietary intake. Despite the
increasing ease of tracking one own’s data, continued engagement
with self-tracking technology is not likely to persist long term
unless the issues of individual motivation, incentives, and habit
formation are also addressed. Recent findings [6, 8] have revealed
that a vast number self-tracking technology adopters eventually
lost their interest in self-tracking over time, leading to reduced
compliance and increased abandonment rate. Many users tended
to use the self-tracking data for short-term goals and migration
between tools was fairly common [28].

To promote continued engagement with self-tracking health
technologies, various financial and non-financial incentive designs
have been proposed. For example, the designs of self-tracking appli-
cations can be improved by providing more meaningful behavioral
insights from the data [6, 8] and improving social sharing to sup-
port observational learning [6]. In the context of randomized health
intervention trials, financial incentives have been commonly used
to motivate health behavior changes and promote self-tracking
compliance [15, 25]. Several researchers [4, 16, 32, 33] argued that
financial incentive is a strong motivator for improving many health-
related behaviors with little to no crowding-out effect [4, 17, 26].
However, a few studies [15, 33] have also shown that achieving ef-
fective results comes with a heavy cost. In the past few years, there
is a growing body of evidence supporting the use of behavioral
economics principles, such as loss aversion [20], in the design of
cost-effective incentive programs [23, 25, 32]. Particularly, financial
incentives framed as loss have been proven to be a stronger motiva-
tor of health behaviors than those typically framed as gain [25, 32]
(henceforth loss-framed and gain-framed incentives, respectively).
This is explained by the fact that people are more likely to act to
avoid loss than to acquire gain as the pain of losing is psycholog-
ically twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining [20]. In many
longitudinal health studies where participants are expected to be
repeatedly administered interventions, e.g., being compensated on

Session: Information Recording & SeekingDH’18, April 23-26, 2018, Lyon, France45a daily basis over a long period of time, the decline in intervention
effectiveness may occur due to the law of diminishing marginal
utility, leading to reduced compliance. The cost-effective design
of repeated financial incentives has not been fully explored, espe-
cially in the context of loss-framed incentives. Furthermore, data
about individuals’ day-to-day dietary choices and habits – captured
via self-tracking and self-reporting – are challenging to acquire
even in non precision medicine cases. The demanding nature of
dietary data collection underscores the importance of incentive
programs necessary for sustaining individual engagement. To our
knowledge, few studies have directly examined the effectiveness
of financial incentives in increasing individuals’ engagement with
dietary self-tracking and self-reporting tasks.

Given the research gaps, we propose a new financial incentive
design called random-loss incentive to address the issue of de-
clining effectiveness of repeated financial incentives. The proposed
incentive incorporates the unpredictability principle, commonly
used in Gamification [5] and behavioral reinforcement [13], into
the design of a loss-framed incentive. Specifically, we hypothesize
that random losses are more effective than fixed losses in promoting
sustained engagement and reducing insensitivity to repeated inter-
ventions as people tend to be overpessimistic about their chance of
suffering higher-than-expected losses.

We conducted a randomized controlled trial to investigate the
effectiveness of the random-loss incentive to improve individuals’
engagement with dietary self-tracking and self-reporting via a new
mobile web application, developed as part of our research, called
the Eat & Tell app. The app is specifically designed to facilitate the
collection of dietary self-tracking and self-reported data through
the food diary data import and the self-report survey components.
It is also randomized trial friendly. Potential participants were asked
to contribute their dietary self-reported data over a period of 30
days. Upon the successful enrollment, participants were randomly
assigned to either the treatment group (random-loss incentive) or
the control group (fixed-loss incentive). At the start of the study,
they were given an initial S$35 worth of credit through the app,
redeemable for a cash payout after 30 days. The final credit value
was determined by their level of compliance with the study protocol.
In the treatment condition, a random amount between S$0 to S$3
was deducted from the credit balance each day if participants failed
to report their dietary intake and behavior on time. On the other
hand, control participants were subjected to a fixed S$1 deduction
amount if the same daily requirements had not been met. The
sum of all deductions was controlled to never exceed S$35 in both
conditions.

The main contributions of our work are: (1) presenting the Eat &
Tell app as a unified research platform to study individuals’ day-to-
day dietary habits by leveraging the quantified-self ecosystems of
food logging apps, integrated self-report surveys, and incentive pro-
grams; (2) introducing a comprehensive set of one-time self-report
surveys to collect individual data, e.g., demographic attributes and
personality measures, as well as recurring self-report surveys to
collect various meal-specific contexts and daily reflection; and (3)
introducing a new random-loss incentive that has been shown via
a randomized trail of 245 participants to increase the compliance
of dietary self-tracking and self-reporting over the fixed-loss incen-
tive.

2 RELATED WORK
2.1 Lifestyle Data and The Quantified Self
Our study is generally related to the quantified self movement [30],
an emerging practice of collecting and analyzing one’s own data
using a wide variety of tools and technologies, including but not
limited to modern wearable devices and mobile sensors, to gain a
better understanding of and improve certain aspects of daily life.
Recently, several studies have explored the use of smartphone, mo-
bile sensing, and wearable technologies to monitor individuals’
physical activities and well-being. For instance, Fernandez-Luque
et al. [12] examined the feasibility of capturing the quantified-self
data from wearable devices and mobile applications in a weight
loss camp for overweight children in Qatar. Kato-Lin et al. [21]
evaluated the effectiveness of visual-based dietary tracking mobile
apps in healthy eating intervention. Rahman et al. [27] proposed a
sensing framework based on signal processing and machine learn-
ing to predict about-to-eat moments for just-in-time interventions.
Wang et al. [34] presented the StudentLife project which employed
a variety of smartphone-based mobile sensing techniques to pas-
sively and actively track well-being and academic performance of
college students. Another related body of work focuses on analyz-
ing self-tracking data in conjunction with other data sources, e.g.,
social media messages, to learn about individuals’ health-related
behaviors. For example, De Choudhury et al. [9] proposed compu-
tational methods to predict individuals’ diet compliance success
using linguistic, activity, and social capital features extracted from
their Twitter messages. Wang et al. [35] studied weight updates
automatically shared on Twitter from a Withings smart scale. In
addition, social media content alone has been shown to be a use-
ful data source for a population-level dietary lifestyle monitoring
[1, 22]. Unlike recent digital health research which utilized obser-
vation data to study health-related behaviors, the results of our
randomized trial are less susceptible to confounding factors.

A common issue in many health monitoring and intervention
studies is the decline in self-tracking compliance over time [12, 21,
34]. One reason is that such self-tracking incentive was deliber-
ately omitted to avoid its confounding effects on the intervention
outcomes [21, 34]. Additionally, study participants are likely to
experience tracking fatigue due to the demanding nature of the
tasks, resulting in reduced compliance [8]. Unlike previous self-
tracking studies which focus primarily on health outcomes, such
as weight loss, we aim to directly address the declining compliance
problem through loss-framed financial incentives. The primary
goal of our study is to investigate the effectiveness of different
loss-framed incentives in improving self-tracking and reporting
compliance in a randomized trial. Compared to past self-tracking
studies [12, 21, 34], our Eat & Tell app is the first to demonstrate
an integrative approach to link self-tracking data with context-
specific self-report surveys via the use of a unified research and
data collection platform, leading to improved user experience.

2.2 Incentives for Health Behavior Change
Past studies have shown strong evidence of financial incentives
in promoting changes in health behaviors, such as smoking cessa-
tion [16, 33], weight loss [32], exercising [4], and physical activity

Session: Information Recording & SeekingDH’18, April 23-26, 2018, Lyon, France46Figure 1: An example of data integration flow in the Eat & Tell app

[14, 15, 25]. Amongst these studies, behavioral economics princi-
ples, such as loss aversion [20] and commitment devices [3, 23],
have been incorporated into the incentive designs to further nudge
individuals toward positive behavior changes. For example, Volpp
et al. [32] showed that individuals who were administered deposit
contract and lottery incentives significantly lost more weights than
non-incentivized individuals. In a recent study by Patel et al. [25],
loss-framed financial incentives were more effective in promoting
physical activity than gain-framed incentives. Milkman et al. [23]
introduced a novel commitment device called temptation bundling
which was shown to be effective in increasing gym attendance.

The design of our random-loss incentive is built upon the appli-
cation of behavioral economics principles, specifically loss aversion
and framing, in influencing health-related behavior change [25]. To
our knowledge, this study is the first randomized trial to examine
the impacts of unpredictability in loss-framed financial incentives
on the individuals’ continued engagement with dietary self-tracking
and self-reporting. Prior work [19, 32] has utilized unpredictability-
based designs in gain-framed incentives (e.g., lottery incentives) to
exploit individuals’ tendency to overestimate small probabilities of
large potential rewards [20], albeit with mixed results [19]. Unlike
lottery incentives where the likelihood of a payout is randomly
determined, we opt for a fixed reward scheduling and introduce
unpredictability during the payout stage similar to Random Re-
wards in Gamification [5], i.e., a randomly determined deduction
amount is made for every non-compliance behavior. Lastly, our
study is the first to comprehensively evaluate the influences of the
incentives in dietary self-tracking studies by controlling for various
personal characteristics including self-efficacy [21], grit [11], age,
and gender, which intrinsically determine individuals’ motivation
and engagement levels.

3 EAT & TELL APP
We begin by describing the Eat & Tell app1, a mobile web applica-
tion built by the authors as a research platform for studying daily
eating habits and behavior change intervention. To facilitate the
data collection process and taking advantage of the quantified self
and self-tracking ecosystems, the app integrates data from popular

1 https://eatntell.sg

mobile food diary apps to generate personalized self-report surveys
for each user based on their food diary records. These surveys are
instrumental in capturing additional behavioral and contextual in-
formation beyond what is provided by the self-tracking data. For
instance, did they have breakfast alone or with other people? Did
they go to a restaurant for lunch? Did they choose to have a partic-
ular meal for dinner because of sensory appeals or convenience?

3.1 Food Diary Data Integration
Food diary data from 3 mobile health and fitness apps, i.e, MyFit-
nessPal, Fitbit, and Healthy 3652 can be automatically synchronized
to the Eat & Tell app via web-based application programming in-
terfaces (APIs). These mobile apps were chosen based on their
popularity amongst users in Singapore where the study took place.
MyFitnessPal is a popular mobile calorie counter which allows
users to track their caloric balance through food and exercise di-
aries. Next, Fitbit is a well-known commercial service helping its
users to track their physical activities, sleep, and food intakes via its
activity trackers and mobile app. Lastly, Healthy 365 is a free-to-use
health and diet tracking mobile app created by the Health Promo-
tion Board of Singapore. Upon successful data synchronization, a
set of self-report surveys are dynamically generated for each user
based on the predefined question templates and their food diary
data. Each survey is associated with meal of the day (i.e., breakfast,
lunch, dinner, and snack) and contains a set of questions about
meal contexts (e.g., venue, meal time, eating companions, etc.), food
choices, and food items logged in the meal. Figure 1 shows an ex-
ample of the data integration flow starting from (1) a user logs
what he/she had for lunch in the Fitbit app, (2) the Lunch survey
is generated in the Eat & Tell app from his/her Fitbit data, and (3)
the user responds to the questions about the food items and (4) the
meal itself.

3.2 Self-Report Surveys
We administer two major types of self-report surveys in the Eat &
Tell app: One-time surveys and daily surveys. Firstly, one-time
surveys are intended to be completed once and consist of standard

2 https://www.healthhub.sg/apps/25/healthy365

Session: Information Recording & SeekingDH’18, April 23-26, 2018, Lyon, France47questionnaires about demographic information (e.g., gender, age,
household income level), general health status (e.g., weight, height,
blood pressure), physical activity level, and personality measures.
To assess the physical activity level, we adopt questions from the
Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity (RAPA) [31] for their brevity.
Next, two personality measures, personality traits and grit, are
administered by 50-item IPIP Big-Five Factor Markers [18] and 12-
item Grit Scale [11], respectively. All users have access to the same
set of one-time surveys.

Secondly, daily surveys are intended to be filled out on a daily
basis and comprise: (1) a set of dynamically generated surveys
(also known as food diary surveys) based on the connected food
diary data; and (2) an end-of-day reflection survey. Questions about
individual food items and meals of the day are included in the food
diary surveys. At a food-item level, we ask users to rate each item
in their diary on a 5-point Likert scale about taste (1 = hated it to 5
= loved it), healthfulness (1 = very unhealthy to 5 = very healthy),
and affordability (1 = very expensive to 5 = very cheap). To lessen
the self-reporting burden, our app keeps track of the users’ most
frequently-logged items and assign default ratings to similar items.
Next, at a meal level, users provide: (1) responses to questions about
meal contexts, such as time of the day, type of venue/meal location,
eating companions, etc.; and (2) reasons for which a particular
meal was chosen in the Food Choice questionnaire [29]. Lastly, the
end-of-day surveys include self-assessment questions about the
users’ subjective well-being and perceived difficulty (self-efficacy)
in logging food diary and completing surveys, among others. The
subjective well-being questions are adopted from a 12-item Scale
of Positive and Negative Experience (SPANE) [10], whereas the 5-
point scale self-efficacy questions are adapted from the similar self-
efficacy questionnaires used in [21]. The survey template containing
all items used in this study is accessible online3.

4 RANDOM-LOSS INCENTIVE
In this section, we describe random-loss incentive, a new loss-
framed financial incentive program designed to address the issue
of declining incentive efficacy caused by repeated administration
of financial incentives over time. In certain longitudinal-study de-
signs where participants are compensated on a regular basis, such
as getting paid each day for achieving the goal of 10,000 steps of
physical activity a day, the effectiveness of subsequent payouts of
the same amount may be decreasing according to the law of dimin-
ishing marginal utility. At the start of the study, a participant may
be significantly motivated to act in exchange for the first $5 payout.
However, as the participant’s financial gain is accumulating over
the course of the study, the next $5 payout has a proportionately
smaller contribution to the total gain and his/her marginal utility.
Before intrinsic motivation and habit are properly developed, the
same fixed-value payout may have less effect on his/her behavior
than past payouts. Similar effects may also apply to loss-framed
incentives. In addition to the use of standard behavioral economics
principles [20], including loss aversion, the endowment effect, and
framing, the design of our random-loss incentive is also inspired by
Random Rewards in Gamification [5] which is based on the princi-
ples of unpredictability and curiosity. The underlying assumption of

3 http://bit.ly/2zHcD9X

our random-loss incentive is that people tend to be overpessimistic
and emotional about their chance of suffering higher-than-expected
losses and are more likely to act to avoid further misfortune than
when facing predictable losses.

Let m be the length of study (m=30 days) and p be the total daily
deduction budget (p=S$30), the steps to assign random losses for
each treatment participant are as follows. First, we generate a prob-
ability vector l of m entries where each entry li is a random positive
real number between 0 and 1 and the sum of all entries is one. Next,
each random loss is computed by multiplying each vector entry li
by p. Finally, we derive for the participant a sequence of m random
losses which add up S$30. This method results in a non-uniform
distribution of random losses which are biased toward less extreme
values, making them characteristically different from lottery-based
incentives. The histogram in Figure 2 shows the distribution of
daily deduction amounts (SD = 0.5838) pre-generated under the
random-loss incentive program for all treatment participants at
the start of the study. As we can see, all random-loss based daily
deductions are between S$0 and S$3.

5 STUDY DESIGN AND PROCEDURES
5.1 Recruitment
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Sin-
gapore Management University. In total, 245 participants were
recruited online through the Facebook advertising platform. An
advertisement campaign was launched to target Facebook users
in Singapore who were 18 years or older, with access to an An-
droid or iOS smartphone, and generally interested in mobile food
diary, self-tracking, and wearable technology. To target these sets
of Facebook users based on their topics of interests, the following
keywords were used: "MyFitnessPal", "Fitbit", "Health Promotion
Board, Singapore", "Activity Tracker", "Smartwatch", and "Wearable
Technology". Based on these criteria, the campaign approximately
reached 400,000 potential audience according to estimates provided
by the Facebook platform. The advertisements described an op-
portunity to participate in a one-month research project to study
individuals’ daily eating habits and food choices in exchange for a
cash compensation of up to S$35 and a chance to win a smartwatch
(approximately S$500 in value) at the end of the study. Clicking
on the advertisements redirected the users to the study website
where study details, requirements to participate, and a link to the
registration page were shown. The campaign ran for 24 days from
May 30 - June 23, 2017. In total, the advertisements were shown
86,533 times (impressions) to 53,635 unique users (reach) yielding

01020300.00.51.01.52.0Daily deduction (S$)CountSession: Information Recording & SeekingDH’18, April 23-26, 2018, Lyon, France482,934 clicks on the ads or 5.47% click-through rate (CTR) per unique
user. More than 80% of Facebook users who clicked on the ads were
women. Ultimately, 257 website visitors from Facebook signed up
to participate yielding 8.76% conversion rate per website visit at a
conversion cost of S$3.84 campaign spending per sign up. Amongst
the potential participants, 5 people failed to complete the registra-
tion process, whereas 7 people eventually dropped out a few days
into the study by revoking their consent.

5.2 Procedures
To register for the study, participants filled out an online registration
form on the Eat & Tell study website. First, they had to give consent
to participate, allowing the research team to collect their personal
data, online food diary records, and survey responses. Next, they
provided their first name, last name, email address, and PayPal
account (for receiving compensation) in the registration form. In
addition, they were required to connect their online food diary
account from one of the supported applications (MyFitnessPal,
Fitbit, and Healthy 365) to the Eat & Tell app, giving the app a
permission to access their food diary data. If they had never used an
online food diary before, they were allowed to sign up for a new food
diary account before resuming the registration process. To complete
the registration, participants were required to confirm their identity
by clicking on the verification link sent to their registered email
address. No multiple sign-ups, e.g., duplicate email addresses or
food diary accounts, were allowed. Additionally, we required a
smartwatch winner to present a valid national identification card
as proof of identity when picking up the prize in person.

Upon successful registration, participants were randomly as-
signed to one of the two experimental groups: treatment (random-
loss incentive) or control (fixed-loss incentive), after which an
introductory email was sent to their registered email address de-
scribing the start and end dates of the study and the study proce-
dures. All participants were first instructed to log in to the Eat & Tell
app and fill out a set of 5 one-time surveys about their demographic
and health information, personality traits, and grit. Next, for each
day in the study, participants were asked to complete a daily task
involving (1) logging their food and drink intakes throughout the
day in the registered food diary app; (2) synchronizing the food
diary data with the Eat & Tell app and filling out surveys about food
choices made in the corresponding diary entries; and (3) filling out
a reflection survey about their subjective well-being and perceived
task difficulty (self-efficacy) which was accessible after 5:00 PM. In
total, it took about 15 - 20 minutes to complete the daily task.

Both treatment and control participants were then informed in
the introductory email that a $35 online credit had been deposited
to their Eat & Tell account. The credit was redeemable for real
money of the same value at the end of the study, paid to them
via the online payment platform Paypal. However, their online
credit was still subjected to being deducted during the course of
the study depending on the completion of the one-time surveys
and the daily tasks. First, $1 would be deducted from their credit
balance for each incomplete one-time survey for all participants.
All one-time surveys were accessible until the end of the study.
Next, participants in each group were told about the deduction
amount for each incomplete daily task specific to their assigned

condition: (1) a random deduction between S$0 to and S$3 for the
treatment group; and (2) a S$1 deduction for the control group. All
daily tasks had to be completed within the next 48 hours (calendar
time). Any overdue surveys were automatically made inaccessible to
participants after its deadline had passed. Next, all participants were
instructed that the total deduction amount would never exceed S$35
(S$5 for one-time surveys and S$30 for all daily tasks). In addition,
their chance of winning a smartwatch was also proportional to
their task completion rate. This was done to discourage anyone
who signed up just to be in the smartwatch sweepstake but never
intended to contribute to the study.

5.3 Automated Email Notifications
To facilitate participants’ compliance with the study protocol, the
Eat & Tell app sent an automated email reminder at 7:00 PM every
day to any participants who had not yet completed the daily task,
notifying them about the remaining time and a potential credit

loss. Participants were allowed to change the schedule of the email
reminder by specifying the preferred time in the app. In total, two
email reminders were sent before the daily task’s due date. Ulti-
mately, if participants did not complete the daily task on time, they
would receive another automated email message at 8:00 AM the
next day after the due date, notifying them about the recent deduc-
tion and offering short motivational messages and helpful tips on
how to make the daily tasks less tedious.

5.4 Participants
All 245 participants who successfully enrolled in the study were ran-
domly assigned to one of the two experimental groups: treatment
(N =135) and control (N =110). Participant characteristics are shown
in Table 1. Despite the S$5 incentive to filling out one-time surveys,
not all participants complied and thus some of the participant de-
mographics and characteristics were missing. A large portion of
the study participants were female (74.02%), which was in line with
other studies of the same nature [21]. There were no significant
differences in the gender distribution between the conditions. Next,
50.8% of participants were 25 - 34 years old. Almost all participants
(95.1%) were Chinese, which was overly represented compared to
the population of Singapore [24]. Next, 70.65% of participants had
a university degree or higher and 69.95% had a full-time employ-
ment. More than half of the study participants (65%) had never been
married. Next, the average body mass index (BMI), calculated from
participants’ self-reported weight and height, of the study partici-
pants was 22.88 (SD = 5.34), which was near the normal weight and
overweight boundary for Asian populations. Additionally, the BMI
distribution was left-skewed, i.e., there were more normal-weight
participants than overweight and obese ones. Next, the average
grit score of participants in our study was 2.75 (SD = 0.58), which
is considered to be moderate. Lastly, only a small portion of par-
ticipants (N =25; 10.2%) had regularly logged food diaries prior to
joining the study. On average, all participants logged 1.3 days (SD =
4.3; median = 0) of food diary in the last 30 days before enrolling in
the study. There were no significant differences in BMI, grit score,
and pre-treatment logging experience between the experimental
groups.

Next, we examine the participants’ food logging and eating be-
havior during the study. The distribution of the number of diary
entries logged per day is shown in Figure 3 where the mean is 6.06
entries (SD = 3.64). On average, treatment participants logged 6.23
entries per day (SD = 3.81), whereas control participants logged
5.81 entries per day (SD = 3.38) as shown in Table 1. There is a
significant difference between the experimental groups according

to the Mann-Whitney U test of diary entries (U =2704500, p<0.01).
Next, to examine the participants’ daily caloric intakes, we first
removed 3 outlying data points whose daily caloric intakes (e.g.,
more than 100K kcal consumed in a single day) were higher than
two standard deviations away from the participants’ mean caloric
intake. Upon further inspection, we found that the outliers were
caused by the inaccuracy in the user-contributed food databases.
Figure 4 displays the distribution of the amount of caloric intake
per day. As we can see from Table 1, on average, all participants
consumed 1254.85 kcal per day (SD = 508.83), whereas treatment
and control participants consumed 1249.05 kcal (SD = 520.14) and
1263.05 kcal (SD = 492.4) per day, respectively. Although control par-
ticipants had a slightly higher mean caloric intake than treatment
participants, the difference is not statistically significant.

Lastly, at the end of the study, 202 participants (111 and 91 in
the treatment and the control conditions, respectively) were con-
sidered intervention participants, i.e., those who received at least
1 deduction and therefore not having full compliance. There is no
significant difference in the numbers of intervention participants
between the two experimental groups.

6 ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
The primary goal of our study is to evaluate the effectiveness of
random-loss and fixed-loss incentives by measuring the partici-
pants’ self-tracking and self-reporting (i.e., daily task) compliance
during the 30-day intervention period. Moreover, our secondary
goal is to examine the effects of the two incentive programs in pro-
moting sustained behavior change after the inventions are removed.
The analysis was conducted on a modified intention-to-treat (mITT)
basis. Specifically, we exclude 43 participants (24 from the treatment
group and 19 from the control group) who did not receive full inter-
ventions from the analysis, i.e., those who were only briefed about
the financial incentive program at the start of the study but never
received any deductions and related email messages throughout
the study due to full compliance. Ultimately, 202 participants are
included in the analysis.

6.1 Preliminary Analysis
We first present a preliminary analysis to examine the participants’
compliance in completing the daily tasks across the experimental
groups. Our outcomes of interest are compliance days, defined as
the number of days a participant completed his/her daily task, and
daily compliance users, defined as the percentage of participants
who completed the daily task on a specific day. The distribution of
the number of days of completed daily tasks by participants from

median number of days of completed daily tasks is 19. In total, 37
participants (18%) did not complete any daily tasks.

Figure 5: Distribution of the number of days participants
completed daily tasks.

Figure 6: Compliance days by experimental group.

Figure 6 shows a box plot of compliance days for the two experi-
mental groups. As we can see, treatment participants generally have
a higher level of compliance with the study protocol than control
participants. The medians compliance days of the treatment and
the control groups are 22 and 15, respectively. The nonparametric
Mann-Whitney U test of compliance days in the two conditions
over the 30-day period shows a significant difference (H0: treatment
= control; U =4142, p<0.05). Uncontrolled, the analysis suggests that
our random-loss incentive is more effective than the fixed-loss in-
centive in improving participants’ daily task completion over 30
days.

have the similar daily compliance users (73.87% and 70.33% for
treatment and control, respectively). However, the compliance trend
continues to decrease over time as the study progresses. This is not
surprising since the declining in compliance is consistent with past
studies on longitudinal health behaviors [21, 23, 25]. Over the 30-
day period, the treatment condition has consistently shown higher
daily compliance users than the control condition. As we can see,
45.95% of treatment participants completed the daily task on the
last day of the study, whereas only 28.09% of control participants
did so.

6.2 Effectiveness of the random-loss incentive
In this section, we present the regression analysis to assess the
effectiveness of our random-loss incentive. Due to the repeated
measures design of the study, we model participants’ daily compli-
ance using mixed effects logistic regression, taking into account
that data points from the same participant are not independent.
The binary dependent variable in our models is the participants’
day-to-day compliance status (1 = a participant completed the task
in time on a given day, otherwise 0). Main effects for experimen-
tal condition (binary predictor; 1 = treatment, otherwise 0) and
interactions between experimental condition and other predictors
(e.g., the number of days into the study for a given participant) are
included. Next, the models control for each participant’s number
of days into the study (from 1 to 30). To adjust for individuals’ pre-
treatment differences in self-tracking experience and self-efficacy,
we also control for the number of food-diary logging days in the
past 30 days before the study started and self-reported perceived
task difficulty for a given day in the study, respectively. Lastly, per-
sonal characteristics, such as gender (binary predictor; 1 = male,
otherwise 0), age, and self-reported grit score (from 1 to 5), are also
controlled for. All analyzes were performed using the lme4 package
(version 1.1.14) [2] in R (version 3.4.2).

The results are presented in Table 2. First, the uncontrolled
baseline model (Model 1) shows that, on any given day, treatment
participants are significantly more likely (p<0.05) to complete the
daily tasks compared to control participants. This suggests that the
random-loss incentive is generally more effective than the fixed-
loss incentive in influencing the participants’ engagement. The
result is also in line with the Mann-Whitney U test of aggregated
participant compliance presented in the preliminary analysis.

Significance thresholds are † p<0.1, * p<0.05, and ** p<0.01.

Next, we evaluate the significance of the decline in compliance
over time, as shown in Figure 7, by controlling for the number of
days since a participant has engaged with the study (Model 2) and
its interaction with the experimental condition (Model 3). Figure
8 displays the interaction effect of interventions and days into
the study on the participants’ likelihood of completing the daily
tasks. A significant interaction term (p<0.05), introduced in Model 3,
indicates that the benefits of the treatment condition depend on the
number of days a participants spent in the study. As participants
spend more time in the study, their compliance tends to decline
across the experimental groups. However, treatment participants
are more likely to complete the tasks than control participants
as the study progresses. That is, a one day increase results in the
odds ratios of 0.91305 and 0.88992 for the treatment condition and
the control condition, respectively. Note that the odds ratios are
obtained from exponentiating the sum of the logistic regression
coefficients for days into the study and its treatment interaction term
In Models 4 and 5, we further assess the main and interaction
effects of the inventions by adding control variables for the par-
ticipants’ prior food logging experience (Model 4) as well as their
current experience in engaging with the daily tasks (Model 5). Af-
ter controlling for these factors, the treatment interaction effect
remains significant (p<0.01) and the results suggest that the effec-
tiveness of our intervention is robust even after adjusting for past
experience and self-efficacy. Moreover, the difference in the odds
ratios between the experimental conditions increases by 9.5% in
Model 5, a considerable gain from the baseline models. As the study
progresses one more day, the odds ratios of the treatment condition

and the control condition are 0.92608 and 0.84562, respectively. Un-
surprisingly, we find that self-efficacy has a positive effect (p<0.01)
on the participants’ likelihood of completing the tasks, i.e., partici-
pants who consider the task to be easy/very easy on a specific day
are more likely to finish it and vice versa. Interestingly, past logging
experience has no significant effect on daily task completion. This
may be explained by the fact that logging food diary is merely a part
of the requirements for completing the daily task. Remembering to
filling out all daily surveys in time is perhaps more demanding to
most participants. Thus, having some familiarity with food logging
is not an major contributor to the participants’ compliance.

Lastly, we examine the main effects of personal characteristics,
i.e., gender, age, and grit, and their treatment interaction effects
on the participants’ day-to-day compliance. These variables are
included in Models 6, 7, and 8 as shown in Table 2. Unlike past
studies [21], none of the personal characteristics have any signifi-
cant impact on the likelihood of completing the daily tasks after
adjusting for other factors. Although participants with higher grit
scores are more likely to complete the daily tasks than those with
lower scores, grit does not significantly impact the participants’
compliance, which is surprising. As suggested by Duckworth et al.
[11], grit constitutes perseverance and passion for long-term goals.
Therefore, one possible explanation is that, even though the par-
ticipants have voluntarily signed up for our study, they may not
have strong passion for the day-to-day self-tracking and reporting
tasks, making grit less effective in this context. Overall, the full
model (Model 8) shows an encouraging result indicating that the
effects of our random-loss incentive on day-to-day compliance is
significant even after controlling for all other factors. According to

Session: Information Recording & SeekingDH’18, April 23-26, 2018, Lyon, France52the full model, the odds of completing the daily tasks for treatment
participants and control participants when the time of the study
increases by 1 day are 0.93723 and 0.87399, respectively.

6.3 Post-intervention self-tracking behavior
In this section, we examine the intervention effects on the par-
ticipants’ change in their dietary self-tracking habit before the
interventions were administered and after they were removed. Ap-
proximately one month after the last participant had completed
the study, we collected the food logging data from all participants
in the following 30 days after their study period was over. Table
3 displays the participants’ food logging behavior in the last 30
days before and after the intervention. First, there is a significantly
larger number of food loggers during the post-intervention than
the pre-intervention phases (40 versus 25; χ 2=3.991, p<0.05). The
gain is due to changes in the participants’ logging habits whereby
25 participants who had never logged any diaries during the pre-
intervention phase continued to log their food intake after the study
was over, whereas 10 participants who had previously logged food
diaries during the pre-intervention phase became inactive there-
after. However, there is no significant difference in the numbers of
active food loggers (defined as those who logged at least 7 days of
food diary in the last 30 days) between the two periods. Amongst
the treatment and the control conditions, we found no significant
differences in the numbers of food loggers (21 versus 19 and) and
active loggers (9 versus 10) post-intervention. Lastly, on average,
all participants logged their diaries more frequently during the
post-intervention than the pre-intervention phases (2.29 versus
1.3) but the difference is not significant. Within a subset of partici-
pants (N =92) who logged their diaries during both periods, there
is a significant increase in the average food diary days from the
pre-intervention to the post-intervention phases (3.47 versus 6.09;
V =1414, p<0.01) but there is no difference between the conditions.

7 CONCLUDING DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this study is the first randomized trial to demon-
strate that framing financial incentives as random loss is effective
in increasing individuals’ engagement with dietary self-tracking
and self-reporting. Particularly, we show that a small unpredictable
loss can serve as a fairly powerful motivator to promote compliance

and alleviate participants’ insensitivity to repeated interventions.
The results are encouraging especially since it is well-established
that loss-framed incentive is a strong motivator for health behavior
change [25, 32]. Our results indicate that individuals who were in
the random-loss incentive program are significantly more likely
to complete the daily tasks than those who were in the fixed-loss
incentive program after controlling for time spent in the study
and other personal characteristics, such as gender, age, prior self-
tracking experience, self-efficacy, and grit. Unlike previous work
[21], we found that the heterogeneity of participants did not affect
the outcomes of the interventions. For instance, male and female
participants did not differ significantly in their likelihood to com-
plete daily tasks. More surprisingly, there is no significant difference
in compliance amongst individuals with differing self-tracking ex-
perience and grit. This may be explained by the facts that: (1) prior
food logging experience marginally contributes to the success of
completing self-report surveys, which is arguably a more demand-
ing requirement of the study; and (2) highly gritty participants may
not necessarily be more passionate about self-tracking and self-
reporting due to its tediousness nature and therefore are not more
likely to persistently pursue the goals than less gritty participants.
At the post-invention phase, we found no significant difference in
the effectiveness of the incentives in sustaining self-tracking behav-
ior for the next 30 days after the interventions were discontinued.
Although there was an initial increase in the number of food loggers
and self-tracking activities during the first post-intervention week,
these numbers substantially declined in the subsequent weeks as
more individuals disengaged from dietary self-tracking. The fact
that the self-tracking behavior was not sustained post-intervention
is not surprising. Unlike typical health intervention studies, partici-
pants in our study were not instructed to use self-tracking tools as a
means to achieve specific health goals nor were they motivated be-
yond the primary scope of the study, i.e., contributing their lifestyle
data to research about dietary habits. Consistent with recent studies
[15, 25], our results confirm the importance of a long-term financial
incentive program in self-tracking studies.

The results have several implications for future precision medicine
and mobile-health (mHealth) studies and interventions. First, our
random-loss incentive is proven to be effective in promoting long-
term engagement with self-tracking regardless of individuals’ per-
sonal characteristics, making it suitable for population-level in-
tervention programs. Next, the cost-effectiveness of our incentive
implies that improved compliance is attainable with relatively mod-
est cost thanks to the effects of loss aversion and unpredictability.
In our setting, the mean cost per participant, including both the
cash and the smartwatch rewards, is less than S$40. Lastly, in terms
of data integrity, we observe very little noise in the food diary en-
tries and survey responses contributed by participants in our study.
Apart from inaccurate nutritional facts of some food items which
we discussed earlier, we find no evidence of misbehavior by our
participants.

Limitations: Our study design specifically focused on dietary
self-tracking and self-reporting compliance in healthy individuals
and did not consider health outcomes, e.g., improved BMI, which
might serve as additional motivation for participants. Understand-
ably, this would have required a different study design and pop-
ulation. Although we initially aimed to representatively recruit

Session: Information Recording & SeekingDH’18, April 23-26, 2018, Lyon, France53participants from Facebook users in Singapore, the majority of par-
ticipants eventually enrolled were female working adults which
may potentially bias the generalizability of the findings. Lastly, fu-
ture studies should further examine the effects of unpredictability
(i.e., the Random Rewards design) on gain-framed and loss-framed
incentives in the same settings.
