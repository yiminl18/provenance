ABSTRACT 
This  paper  describes  the  design  of  “ArmSleeve”,  a  patient 
monitoring  system  to  support  occupational  therapists  in 
their  upper  limb  rehabilitation  work  with  stroke  patients. 
Occupational therapists can provide rehabilitation in clinics, 
but they have limited insights into how much their patients 
use  their  affected  arm  and  hand  in  daily  life,  which  is 
critical for effective recovery to occur. Our work addresses 
interrelated  studies:  (1)

interviews  with 
their  current 
rehabilitation  practices;  (2)  the  design  of  the  “ArmSleeve 
Sensor”  to  monitor  a  patient’s  upper  limb  movement;  and 
(3) 
the  “ArmSleeve 
Dashboard” to visualize this information for therapists. The 
findings show the importance of collecting objective data to 
assess  exercise  and  activities  outside  therapy,  but  also  a 
lack  of  contextual  information  to  interpret  this  data.  We 
discuss considerations for how to address this issue through 
patient engagement as well as considerations for designing 
wearable sensor technology that is usable in everyday life.

disabilities  being  paralysis  of  an  upper  limb  [25].  People 
living with stroke often have difficulty producing voluntary 
movement and experience difficulty in coordinating fingers, 
hands  and  arms.  They  can  also  experience  deficits  in 
sensation and proprioception, as well as muscle shortening 
and  weakness,  which  further  complicate  upper 
limb 
movement. It is estimated that 65% of those who live with 
stroke also live with a resulting disability that affects their 
ability  to  independently  carry  out  activities  of  daily  living 
(ADL) such as eating, dressing and washing [13].  

Occupational therapists (OTs) can support stroke patients in 
re-developing  motor  skills  and  in  learning  to  perform 
activities  of  daily  living.  During  therapy  sessions  OTs 
employ  a  variety  of  techniques  to  support  rehabilitation, 
such as functional electrical stimulation, constraint induced 
motor  training,  facilitation,  and  virtual  reality  applications 
[5, 27]. Furthermore, OTs provide patients with exercises to 
engage  the  affected  arm  in  everyday  activities  that  are 
context  specific,  such  as  reach  and  grasp  tasks  in  the 
kitchen  and  bathroom  [31].  This  combination  of  therapy, 
exercise  and  context  specific  retraining  is  critical  for 
neuroplasticity  [30].  However,  adherence  to  rehabilitation 
programs  is  often  low  due  to  the  effort  required  to  use  a 
paretic  upper  limb,  lack  of  motivation,  musculoskeletal 
issues,  and  fatigue  [16].  Additionally,  OTs  lack  objective 
data  about  the  degree  to  which  exercises  have  been

performed, or about how much patients have engaged their 
affected upper limb at home. While retrospective recall and 
exercise  diaries  can  gather  subjective  data,  the  quality  of 
this data is limited and relies on patients that are motivated 
and have adequate cognition [33].  

The  aim  of  our  research  is  to  support  occupational 
therapists (and stroke patients) by providing a collection of 
objective data about patient upper limb movement in daily 
life.  In  this  paper  we  firstly  report  on  an  analysis  of  OT's 
current  practices  and  needs,  such  that  they  able  to  better 
understand  a  patient’s  upper  limb  movement  in  daily  life. 
Based  on  these  insights  we  then  report  on  the  design  and 
evaluation of the ArmSleeve system. The system consists of 
the  ArmSleeve  Sensor  to  monitor  upper  limb  movement, 
and  the  ArmSleeve  Dashboard  which  provides  therapists 
access to upper limb movement information (see Figure 1). 
Based  on  design  workshops  and  interviews  with  OTs  we 
show how the dashboard can enhance rehabilitation through 
ongoing assessment and improved patient engagement.

HCI Work on Upper Limb Rehabilitation After a Stroke  
There  is  a  growing  body  of  HCI  work  on  supporting 
rehabilitation  after  a  stroke.  The  majority  of  this  work 
focuses  on  patients,  often  through  interactive  games 
combined  with  emerging 
to 
encourage  upper  limb  exercise.  Boulanger  et  al.  explored 
the multi-touch capabilities of the Microsoft Surface Table 
to  design  games  that  encourage  patients  to  exercise  finger 
and  wrist  extension  movements  [7].  The  CONTRAST 
system also uses games on a tabletop display to encourage 
exercise  but  includes  physical  objects,  like  a  cup,  to 
exercise grasping and moving actions on a tabletop surface 
[15]. The PhysiCube system utilizes tangible objects (Sifteo 
Cubes)  and  game  mechanisms  to  encourage  patients  to 
practice grasp and lift movements [34]. Khademi et al. used 
the  Leap  Motion  hand  tracking  system  and  a  modified 
version  of  the  game  of  Fruit  Ninja  to  help  stroke  patients 
practice  their  finger  individuation  [18].  Peiris  et  al.  built 
SHRUG,  an  interactive  shoulder  rehabilitation  exerciser, 
which allows patients to train the affected shoulder together 
with  the  unaffected  shoulder  by  lifting  a  bar  onto  prongs 
[26].  All  of  these  systems  are  designed  for  patient  use  in 
clinical settings to engage in rehabilitative exercises.  

line  of  HCI  work  focuses  on  designing 
A  second 
rehabilitative  systems  that  patients  can  use  in  their  own 
homes.  This research  aims  to  design for  exercise  activities 
that  are  meaningful  to  the  patient  and  that  fit  into  the 
routines  of  their  daily  lives.  For  example,  Alankus  et  al. 
designed  motion-based  games  and  deployed  them  in  the 
home  of  a  woman  who  was  17  years  post-stroke  [2].  In 
another example, Balaam et al. used a participatory design 
approach  to  create  artifacts  for  people  living  with  the 
effects  of  a  stroke  [3].  In  both  cases,  researchers  faced 
challenges  in  balancing  the  need  for  activities  that  are 
the  demands  of 
meaningful  and  motivating,  with 

rehabilitation  work.  Furthermore,  their  work highlights  the 
importance of understanding the social context in which an 
interactive  system  might  be  used,  including  the  role  of 
family and informal carers. 

There  is  far  less  research  on  the  needs  of  clinicians, 
especially  the  occupational  therapists  (OTs),  who  care  for 
patients  during  rehabilitation.  Moraiti  et  al.  worked  with 
OTs to explore the use of Do-It-Yourself (DIY) toolkits like 
Arduino and the Skweeze system, which can be embedded 
into  everyday  objects  like  cushions  and  socks  [23].  By 
embedding  these  toolkits  into  everyday  objects,  the  OTs 
learnt  how  to  develop  their  own  smart  therapeutic  aids, 
tailored for the specific interests and needs of their patients. 

Monitoring Upper Limb Movements in Daily Life  
HCI offers a wide range of work on monitoring health and 
wellbeing over extended periods of time in daily life under 
the  umbrellas  of  personal  informatics  [20]  and  Quantified 
Self  [9].  This  work  is  often  driven  by  body-worn  sensors 
(e.g., Fitbit, Jawbone Up) to monitor lower limb movement, 
i.e., how much (typically healthy) people walk and exercise 
in daily life [28]. 

Beursgens et al. applied a personal informatics approach to 
design  Us’em:  a  watch-like  device  worn  on  both  arms  to 
monitor  upper  limb  movement  of  stroke  patients  in  daily 
life [6]. Us’em only measures acceleration at the wrist. The 
system  does  not  isolate  upper  limb  movement  from  torso 
movements, nor does it precisely measure how a particular 
part of the upper limb moves. Nevertheless, by providing a 
comparison  in  activity  levels  between  the  affected  and  the 
unaffected upper limb it provides a useful starting point to 
understand  how  much  the  affected  upper  limb  of  a  stroke 
patient is engaged in daily life. 

Accurate  upper  limb  monitoring  systems  using  body-worn 
sensors  are  difficult  to  implement  due  to  its  complexity  –
both  conceptual  and  technological.  The  upper  limb  moves 
with many degrees of freedom at the shoulder, elbow, wrist 
and fingers. Unlike walking, where well-established models 
exist  to  describe  and  quantify  steps  [35],  upper  limb 
motions  are  difficult  to  quantify  due  to  their  variety  in 
shape.  Likewise,  while  pedometers  can  monitor  steps  with 
one  sensor,  accurate  upper  limb  monitoring  requires 
multiple connected sensors to distinguish between shoulder 
and elbow movements, and to exclude movements coming 
from the torso. Despite these difficulties, studies in clinical 
settings  over  short  timespans  have  shown  that  sensors  can 
capture  upper  limb  motion  of  healthy  participants  and 
stroke patients with some success [11, 19, 32].  

In  summary,  there  are  various  strong  efforts  to  engage 
patients  living  with  the  effects  of  a  stroke  in  upper  limb 
exercise  and  to  monitor  their  movement.  While  this  focus 
on 
little 
consideration  for  the  needs  of  occupational  therapists  and 
on creating systems that allow them to benefit from the data 
collected by upper limb monitoring systems.

The aim of this research is to design a system that supports 
the  practices  of  occupational  therapists  (OTs)  in  providing 
data  about  the  upper  limb  movement  of  stroke  patients  in 
daily life. In particular, this research aims to (1) understand 
the current practices and needs of OTs, (2) design a body-
worn  sensor  system  (ArmSleeve  Sensor)  to  monitor  upper 
limb  movement,  and  (3)  design  a  web-based  dashboard  to 
visualize  the  movement  data  to  support  OTs  (ArmSleeve 
Dashboard).  The 
is  called 
“ArmSleeve”,  because  the  team  envisioned  a  system 
consisting  of  multiple  sensors  along  the  arm  to  monitor 
movement,  which  could  eventually  be  embedded  in  the 
sleeve of a shirt. The final system described here consisted 
of a wearable technology worn on the patient’s arm.

Research Setting 
This  research  was  conducted  in  collaboration  with  a  large 
tertiary  hospital  in  Melbourne.  The  hospital  offers  various 
rehabilitation programs for stroke patients, including upper 
limb  programs 
services. 
Rehabilitation  of  the  upper  limb  is  a  core  practice  of 
therapists across both inpatient and outpatient settings.  The 
primary  goal  of  occupational  therapy  interventions  are  to 
enable people to participate in their activities of daily living 
ranging  from  personal  and  domestic  tasks,  through  to 
community, employment, leisure and recreational activities. 

community 

therapy 

and 

Patients experiencing a stroke are initially managed within 
the  acute  stroke  unit  by  a  team  of  medical,  nursing  and 
allied  health  staff.  Patients  receive  occupational  therapy 
intervention  a  minimum  of  3  times  per  week.  Patients 
requiring  further  rehabilitation  may  be  transferred  to  the 
sub-acute  inpatient  setting.  The  length  of  stay  for  a  period 
of inpatient rehabilitation varies from a couple of weeks up 
to  many  months.  These  patients  receive  occupational 
therapy  intervention  on  a  daily  basis.  Chronic  stroke 
patients who are residing within the community may attend 
community-based  therapy  where  they  attend  for  up  to  3 
sessions per week over a 6 – 10 week period.   

The  hospital  recently  established  a  ‘hub’  with  upper  limb 
workstations  based  on  robotic  and  gaming  technology.  A 
dedicated movement laboratory has also been developed to 
assess and study patient progress. While these technologies 
provide  support  during  rehabilitation  sessions,  the  OTs 
were  keen  to  explore  how  technology  could  monitor  and 
support  patients  outside 
therapy  sessions  and  more 
specifically in home and community settings. 

Research Approach 
We conducted this research through a series of research and 
design  activities  with  10  OTs  at  the  Royal  Melbourne 
Hospital. These activities involved the following: 

  Study 1 - understand OT practices and needs,  
  Study 2 - design and evaluate the ArmSleeve Sensor to 
track arm movement through wearable technology, and  

  Study  3  -  design  and  evaluate

STUDY 1: PRACTICES AND NEEDS OF THERAPISTS 

Research Aim and Study Design 
The  aim  of  study  1  was  to  examine  the  practices  of  OTs, 
specifically  to  understand  their  needs  for  monitoring 
patients  in  between  therapy  sessions.  The  first  author 
conducted  semi-structured  interviews  with  8  OTs  working 
in  upper  limb  rehabilitation.  One  OT  was  a  student,  all 
other  OTs  had  at  least  2  years  of  clinical  experience.  The 
interviews  focused  on  current  practices  of  OTs,  i.e.,  how 
they assess and treat patients during upper limb therapy and 
how  they  currently  elicit  information  about  the  patient’s 
activities in between therapy session.  

We  prepared  a  video  showing  one  of 
the  authors 
performing  activities  of  daily  living  (eating,  cleaning, 
opening doors) in the manner of a stroke patient. This video 
was  used  as  a  probe  in  the  interview  to  elicit  how  OTs 
analyze  upper  limb  movements  and  what  information  they 
would  desire  if  they  could  observe  a  patient  in  daily  life 
outside the clinic. The interviews lasted 30 minutes and the 
recordings were transcribed verbatim for later analysis. 

We  analyzed  the  data  qualitatively  following  a  thematic 
approach  [8]  to  examine  how  OTs  currently  assess  upper 
limb  movement  and  what  information  they  desire  about 
their  patients.  Immediately  following  each  interview,  the 
first author created mind-maps to capture themes emerging 
in  the  interview.  Authors  1  and  2  listened  to  the  audio 
recordings  and  read  through  all  interview  transcripts  to 
familiarize themselves with the data. After generating initial 
codes  on  paper  about  what  information  OTs  seek  and 
desire,  Saturate  [1],  was  used  to  code  all  transcripts. 
Recurring codes and emerging themes were refined through 
discussion  and  affinity  diagraming  with  the  other  authors, 
and are presented as findings below.

Meaningful Goals, Activities and Motions 
The  role  of  an  Occupational  Therapist  (OT)  is  to  improve 
their  patient's  ability  to  perform  activities  of  daily  living 
(ADL). Hence at the start of the rehabilitation process OTs 
establish  which  activities  are  important  to  the  life  of  a 
patient  and  define  goals  that  are  meaningful  to  the  patient 
and  realistic 
the 
rehabilitation.  These  goals  often  focus  on  fundamental 
activities like dressing and feeding, e.g., to “open his hand 
up  so  he’s  able  to  grasp  the  drink  bottle  and  with  the  two 
hands,  bring  the  drink  bottle  to  his  mouth.”  (OT5).  Goals 
also include activities that may seem less essential for daily 
living,  yet  are  important  and  therefore  motivating  to  the 
patient, like being able to play a musical instrument again. 
“I have a patient that has a little bit of shoulder movement, 
some flickers in his elbow but no movement in his wrist. His 
goal was to be able to play the ukulele and to strum it with

your hopes but picturing that more as a long term goal … 
we refined the goal together so the goal is now in the four 
weeks  that  he's  able  to  independently  position  his  arm  on 
his ukulele as a pre-cursor to strumming it.” (OT3) 

An important skill of the OT is to break down meaningful 
activities  (like  playing  the  ukulele)  into  simple  motions 
(like  lifting  the  arm  from  the  shoulder  and  flexing  the 
elbow).  OTs  also  compose whole  activities  based on  these 
simple  motions.  Such  OT  skills  are  critical  to  establish 
goals that are realistic based on the capabilities of a patient. 
Identifying  relevant  motions  related  to  activities  is  also 
critical to set exercises performed during rehabilitation and 
to correct motions performed in an unhealthy manner.

Exercise and Activities Outside Therapy 
Rehabilitation  progress 
intensive 
exercise of the upper limb during a therapy session as well 
as  outside  therapy.  The  number  of  upper  limb  therapy 
sessions per week varied from one to five therapy sessions 
per week, depending on whether patients stayed at the clinic 
or at home. Regardless of how many therapy sessions they 
had, 
time  spent 
exercising  during  therapy  was  not  sufficient  to  make 
progress.  Hence  many  patients  received  programs  to 
exercise their upper limb outside therapy. 

therapists  emphasized

the 

“I work in community-based rehab, so I see someone for an 
hour  ...  It's  such  a  small  period  of  time  in  their  weekly 
schedule … Our patients need to be doing a whole lot more 
therapy and that therapy needs to be task oriented, it needs 
to  be  meaningful,  and  it  needs  to  be  mass  practice  and 
repetition  outside  of  the  hours  that  we  see  them,  which  is 
why  we  develop  home  exercise  programs  for  people.  They 
really  need  to  be  doing  an  hour  of  repetitive  upper  limb 
therapy a day I would say to make progress.” (OT3)  

These exercise programs focused on repetitive sets of either 
specific  motions  or  functional  activities.  Examples  of 
motion-based  exercises  include  “practicing  to  do  wrist 
extension,  and  also  against  gravity”  (OT1)  and  “basic 
reach and basic shoulder and elbow movements – reaching 
out  and  looking  at  trying  to  reduce  his  compensatory 
movements”  (OT3).  Alternatively,  examples  of  functional 
exercises given by the OTs include: “bringing his left hand 
up to his mouth to hold a spoon” (OT6), or “practicing to 
reach for a cup, and repetitions of that as many as they can, 
over an hour in the afternoons each day” (OT1). 

Additionally,  OTs  encouraged  patients  to  use  their  upper 
limb  in  activities  of  daily  living  when  opportunities  arise. 
For  example,  “wash  dishes  with  [the  patient’s]  affected 
arm” (OT3) or “shaking people’s hands” (OT5). 

Objective Data to Assess Exercise and Activities 
It is very difficult for an OT to discern whether a patient has 
adequately completed her exercise program and to know to 
what  extent  a  patient  is  actually  using  her  upper  limb  in 
other  activities  of  daily  living.  OTs  typically  discuss  the 

patient’s  activities  and  exercise  programs  at  the  start  of  a 
rehabilitation session and some patients keep diaries to keep 
track  of  their  exercise.  This  discussion  works  well  for 
patients who are motivated, and some therapists pointed out 
that  they  could  infer  whether  patients  adhered  to  their 
exercise program based on their progress (or lack thereof). 
Regardless of the progress, however, the therapists desired 
more  detailed  information  on  the  activity  levels  of  their 
patients:  “I  see  them  on  a  Wednesday,  after  giving  them 
exercises – I still don’t get a real sense of what’s happening 
for  them  over  that  24  hour  period,  how  much  that  arm  is 
being moved and engaged [in activities]. I still feel like I’m 
really  lost  from  that  point  of  view.  And  to  show  that  what 
we are doing from the therapy point of view is effective, we 
need this information.” (OT1) 

The  OTs  hence  desired  objective  data  about  the  exercises 
and other activities of daily living (ADL) that their patients 
performed with the affected arm. Their key questions were: 
(1) “Whether they're doing their home exercise program or 
not.” (OT3), and (2) “How much they’re using their arm in 
things [ADL] like showering, getting dressed. Is it hanging 
like a dead weight by their side, and then they’re using their 
right  arm  to  do  everything,  or  are  they  actually  trying  to 
use that left hand a little bit?” (OT6) 

Achieving  objective  data  about  upper  limb  movement  is 
also conceptually difficult. How do we quantify upper limb 
movements?  Do  we  collect  data  for  each  joint  by  joint  or 
the  arm  as  a  whole?  And  how  do  we  describe  objectively 
how much or how well a patient engages the upper limb in 
an  activity  like  eating  a  meal?  To  understand  these  issues 
from  an  OT’s  perspective,  we  discussed  with  them  the 
previously  mentioned  video  of  a  person  performing 
exercises  and  activities.  We  asked  the  OTs  to  think  aloud 
what  they  observed  in  this  video  and  how  they  would 
quantify  their  observations.  Through  these  discussions  we 
learnt that OTs desire the following data: 

  Number  of  movements,  ideally  based  on  exercises 
activities,  or  alternatively  as  motions  for  each  joint 
(shoulder,  elbow,  wrist,  fingers):  “it  would  be  really 
good to know that the arm is moving in the first place, 
that they are actually using that arm. If we get down to 
the  nitty-gritty  it  would  be  really  nice  to  know  if  the 
shoulder  is  moving  or  the  elbow  is  moving,  or  what 
joints  they  are  actually  moving  to  assist  them  with 
doing that task.” (OT1) 

  Time spent moving the arm: “Are they incorporating 
their  arm  [into  ADL]?  For  how  long?”  (OT1)”;  “it’s 
good if they’re using their arm to do their exercises for 
half an hour a day [during therapy], that is important, 
but  the  more  important  thing  is  that  they’re  using  the 
other twenty-three-and-a-half hours of the day.” (OT6) 
  Quality  of  movements  based  on  observations  of 
unnatural  motions  and  compensatory  movements,  like 
lifting  the  shoulder  to  reach  forward:  “There's  always 
that  risk  of  them  doing  a  home  exercise  program  and

(e.g.,  shoulder  abduction)  and  (2)  activities  of  daily  living 
(e.g., lift a can to the mouth, open a door). Motion data for 
each  task  and  for  each  degree  of  freedom  at  the  shoulder 
and elbow was exported from both systems for comparison. 

The  analysis  showed  that  the  ArmSleeve  system  collects 
data that is comparable to the data generated by the Vicon® 
system.  Figure  3  shows  motion  data  captured  by  both  the 
ArmSleeve  and  the  Vicon  system  for  5  sets  of  abduction 
motions,  where  the participant  was  swinging  the right  arm 
along the frontal plane and back. It can be observed that the 
ArmSleeve system was capable of producing similar data to 
that produced by the Vicon. Particularly, the measurements 
in  flexion/extension  of  both  the  wrist  (bottom  graph)  and 
shoulder  (top),  and  abduction/adduction  of  the  shoulder 
(top)  are  well  represented.  However,  measurements  of 
shoulder axial rotation, and wrist are less accurate. In other 
movements,  both 
those 
involving activities of daily living, we observed some other 
differences in the measurements – particularly offsets in the 
reported  angles.  In  these  instances,  the  overall  changes  in 
the  degrees  of  motion  are  consistent,  however,  the  sensors 
report different starting angles.  

the  simple  movements  and 

Differences  in  the  data  generated  by  the  ArmSleeve  and 
Vicon  systems  are  predominantly  due  to  errors  in  the 
placement of the sensors on the arm. To address this issue 
sensors  need  to  be  properly  aligned  through  careful 
application of the straps, and they need to be secured such 
that they do not move. Another limitation of the data relates 
to the accuracy of the Vicon. In some instances, the Vicon 
reported  angles  that  are  impossible  for  a  human  body  to 
achieve.  This has obvious  implications on  the  comparison. 
Furthermore,  the  Vicon  data  is  strongly  filtered  and  hence 
produces  smoother  graphs,  which  makes  it  difficult  to 
conduct a statistical comparison with the ArmSleeve data.  

The  ArmSleeve  prototype  shows  that  upper  limb  motions 
can  be  captured  accurately  in  the  lab,  but  further  work  is 
required  to  produce  data  on  number  of  movements,  time 
spent  moving  and  indications  of  quality.  Furthermore, 

significant work is required to develop sensors suitable for 
patient use in everyday life. In addition to more secure and 
precise straps, they must also be correctly packaged, so that 
they are easy to put on and take off, are easily charged, and 
data can be easily transferred by patients or therapists.  

STUDY  3:  DESIGN  AND  EVALUATION  OF  THE 
ARMSLEEVE DASHBOARD 

Research Aim and Study Design 
The  aim  of  study  3  was  to  design  and  evaluate  the 
ArmSleeve  dashboard.  The  dashboard  was  designed  for 
OTs to visualize a patient’s arm motions as captured by the 
ArmSleeve sensors. 

This  dashboard  was  created  through  a  series  of  design 
workshops.  The  first  workshop  was  conducted  within  the 
research team, based on brainstorming and sketching ideas 
in  response  to  the  findings  from  study  1.  A  second 
workshop  was  conducted  with  two  OTs,  which  also 
involved  sketching  ideas  followed  by  a  discussion  of  the 
sketches  from  the  initial  workshops.  This  workshop  led  to 
the  ideas  for  the  four  main  visualizations  presented  in  the 
ArmSleeve  dashboard  (see  Figure  4).  The  sketches  were 
iterated 
through 
into  paper  prototypes  and  mockups 
ongoing discussion with the two OTs and the research team. 
The  final  prototype  used  for  the  evaluation  was  an 
interactive HTML prototype created with Axure RP.  

fresh  perspective  on 

We  evaluated  the  dashboard  with  the  same  8  OTs  as  in 
study  1  to  assess  how  useful  the  information  presented  in 
the  dashboard  is  for  their  rehabilitation  practices.  These 
OTs were not involved in the creation of the dashboard and 
hence  provided  a 
ideas 
encapsulated  in  the  design.  We  asked  the  OTs  to  explore 
the  different  dashboard  visualizations  and  to  think  aloud 
their first impressions and how they would incorporate this 
information into their work. We asked them questions about 
how useful they considered the visualizations presented on 
the dashboard for their own work and discussed options for 
revising  the  dashboard  to  enhance  its  usefulness.  The 
evaluation 
the 
lasted  approximately  30  minutes  and 
recordings were transcribed verbatim for our analysis.

We analyzed the data through a thematic approach [8] like 
in  study  1.  Authors  1  and  4  immersed  themselves  into  the 
data and coded the transcripts using the qualitative analysis 
tool  Saturate.  The  themes  presented  in  the  findings  show 
how  useful  different  dashboard  visualizations  were  to 
enhance the practices of OTs, as well as their limitations. 

ArmSleeve Dashboard Design 
The ArmSleeve Dashboard was designed in response to the 
findings of study 1, the constraints of the prototype of study 
2, and ideas emerging in design workshops.  

We  sought  to  design  a  dashboard  that  OTs  can  use  in  a 
variety of ways: to get a quick overview before the therapy, 
to  engage  a  patient  in  conversation  with  the  data  during 
therapy, and to conduct clinical research on the relationship

in  the  data  with  activities  like  eating  or  exercising:  “we 
could  get  them  to  keep  a  diary  or  something  like  that  and 
when they come then sit down with their diary.” (OT3) 

The joints section provided a more detailed analysis of the 
progress  made  by  a  patient  through  the  range  of  motion 
(ROM)  for  each  degree  of  freedom  at  the  shoulder,  elbow 
and wrist. Improvements in the ROM are not always visible 
in therapy sessions, and therapists typically do not have the 
time to assess it in each therapy session. Seeing progress in 
ROM  however  is  useful  to  see  how  patients  progress  over 
the  course  of  a  therapy  and  also  to  detect  discrepancies 
between  how  patients  perform  in  therapy  and  how  they 
perform  at  home:  “the  maximum  is  very  useful  to  know 
because  this  client,  when  we  test  him,  he  can  actually 
achieve a 130° of shoulder flexion and yet he’s only getting 
84° when he’s using it outside of therapy.” (OT6).  

Heat  maps  were  useful  to  assess  the  activity  levels  of 
particular  patients,  i.e.,  patients  with  very  low  levels  of 
mobility,  and  patients  with  hemispatial  neglect,  who  have 
difficulty to attend to one side of space. Heat maps showed 
if  these  patients  predominantly  had  their  affected  arm  in  a 
resting  position,  or  if  they  were  moving  it  regularly: 
“‘Cause you want to know when they’re sitting particularly 
the  ones  that  have  neglect,  do  they  just  leave  it  dangling 
down here or are they positioning it in an appropriate way? 
I  like  that.  It’s  good.”  (OT4)  The  heat  maps  also  showed 
whether the hand of the patient crosses the midline of their 
body.  This  indicates  attendance  to  the  neglected  side  in 
neglect  patients,  and  it  shows  an  increased  range  of 
activities of daily living that a patient can perform: “if you 
can  cross  midline  and  do  stuff  you  are  getting  better 
plasticity showing but you’re also functionally significantly 
more independent than if you can only work here.” (OT8) 

Engage Patients and Other Clinicians 
A  key  strength  of  ArmSleeve  is  that  OTs  can  use  it  to 
engage  with patients  and  other  clinicians.  Firstly,  OTs  can 
use the data presented on the dashboard for discussion with 
patients  to  get  a  better  understanding  of  their  exercise 
levels, activities of daily living, and more broadly, how they 
cope  in  daily  life.  Particularly  the  timeline  data  and  the 
tagging  feature  invited  opportunities  for  OTs  to  engage 
their  patients  to  learn  more  about  exercise  and  other 
activities: “I'd sit down with the patient and ask what they 
were doing between 8am and 10am on Friday and they say 
they  went  to  the  gym  so  I  put  in  exercise.”  (OT3). 
Therapists  can  use  the  data  to  inquire  about  how  well 
patients  cope  with  the  exercise  programs  that  they  have 
been given: “are they coping with what I've given them? If 
they're  not  doing  their  exercises,  why?”  (OT7)  Therapists 
may also use trends in the timeline data to ask more broadly 
about how the wellbeing of their patients: “we can actually 
show them the days that they are doing better, and actually 
talk about, let’s say ‘Monday wasn’t so good’, maybe they 
had a lot of scans and investigations. Or maybe they had a 
really bad day and didn’t want to do their rehab.” (OT1).  

to 

them.”  (OT3).  Some 

The  dashboard  also  provides  opportunities  for  OTs  to 
engage, educate and empower patients in the rehabilitation 
process. Patients can use the data to learn more about how 
the arm works, what their capabilities are, and how they are 
progressing: “I use that in two senses - to provide patients 
with motivation and say they've improved a little more this 
week and the flip side is if they're not improving I provide 
realistic feedback so in three weeks time when I discharge 
them from the service and they're ‘my arm hasn't improved’ 
it's  not  a  shock 
therapists 
emphasized that the dashboard provides a useful, additional 
voice  to  the  therapy  that  motivates  patients:  “I  think  it's 
quite  motivating  for  patients.  It's  not  just  me  speaking  to 
them.” (OT7) Some therapists liked the heat map to discuss 
with  their  patients  which  areas  they  need  to  target  when 
moving their arm: “if it was all just red by his body [on the 
heat  map]  I  could  talk  to  him  about  how  it’s  really 
important to let that arm sit down and extend the elbow to 
involve it one day in swinging while he’s walking.” (OT2). 
it  provides  an  opportunity  for  patients  and 
Finally, 
therapists  to  collaboratively  inquire  the  data  and  to  adjust 
the goals of the therapy accordingly: “It would be nice to be 
able  to  show  patients  visually  how  they  are  doing,  and  be 
able  to  say  ‘this  is  where  we  want  you  to  be.  This  is  your 
target for the next 2 weeks’. And then you could be pushing 
that target out as they improve.” (OT1) 

Finally,  therapists  can  also  use  this  data  to  advocate  for 
their  patients  in  communication  with  other  clinicians.  The 
dashboard data is helpful in communicating the progress of 
a  patient  to  other  team  members:  “other  therapists,  your 
physio  colleagues,  or  your  doctors,  they  can  actually  see 
that  the  patient’s  arm  movement  is  improving.”  (OT5) 
Objective  data  on  the  progress  of  a  patient  can  help 
therapists to advocate for their patients to receive adequate 
resources  required  for  rehabilitation:  “often  what  we  are 
doing is advocate for rehab. And not every patient gets the 
rehab. If we can show to the team that they made all these 
improvements in terms of arm function, our case would be 
so much stronger.”(OT1). 

information  presented  across 

Lack of Contextual Information 
A major limitation of the ArmSleeve system  is the lack of 
contextual 
the  different 
dashboard  pages.  First  and  foremost  this  was  evident  in 
discussions  about  what  a  movement  presented  on  the 
timeline  page  may  mean.  For  instance,  based  on  the 
dashboard  alone  therapists  cannot  know  if  a  movement 
constitutes an exercise activity, if the patient is engaging in 
an activity of daily living like eating, if the arm is swinging 
while  walking,  or  if  the  arm  is  moved  by  a  caretaker  who 
helps the patient get dressed: “I find it really hard because 
you don’t know what they’re doing when they’re doing this 
movement.  Like  I  could  be  walking,  going  like  this  and 
that’s  going  to  be  counting  the  movement  of  every  joint 
whereas  it’s  not  specifically  functional.”  (OT4)  The 
timeline  presents  some  contextual  information  through  the 
time of the day when movements are performed, which can 

Sensing, HealthDIS 2016, June 4–8, 2016, Brisbane, Australia707indicate  that  a  patient  is  eating  or  washing.  However,  the 
precise  nature  of  the  activity  needs  to  be  confirmed  in 
conversation with a patient.  

Secondly, the lack of contextual information was reflected in 
discussions  of  the  quality  ratings.  The  quality  rating  was 
displayed on the overview page as an average value between 
1 and 10 for all the movements performed over the course of 
a  day,  thus  allowing  the  OTs  to  see  trends  in  the  data  over 
several days and weeks. The OTs desired information about 
the quality of movements outside therapy, but they felt that in 
order  to  truly  judge  the  quality  of  a  movement,  they  would 
have  to  see  their  patient:  “quality  is  something  you  really 
need  to  see.”  (OT4)  This  is  because  the  quality  of  a 
movement is dependent on its purpose in a particular context. 
For example, shoulder abduction is often used as an indicator 
for  low  quality,  because  many  stroke  patients  exhibit 
excessive  abduction  while  reaching  forward.  However,  in 
certain  contexts  abduction  can  be  a  normal,  high  quality 
movement, which cannot be distinguished by the ArmSleeve 
system:  “I  have  some  questions  about  measuring  quality. 
This doesn't have any way to determine the movements are of 
quality and whether they're normal or not, it's just detecting 
[motion]  -  for  some  tasks  a  quality  movement  would  be  to 
abduct your arm, like to you bring your hand up to do your 
hair,  and  for  reaching,  to  abduct  your  arm  isn't  a  normal 
movement.  So  if  you're  able  to  measure  abduction  but  then 
you're  not  able  to  know  what  the  task  is,  how  do  you 
determine whether that's a quality movement for that task?” 
(OT3) 

DISCUSSION 
HCI offers a growing body of work technology designed to 
support patients after a stroke, i.e., in exercising [2, 3, 15, 26] 
and  monitoring  [6,  11,  19,  32].  While  this  focus  on  the 
patient is important, the main contribution of this research is 
a  system  designed  to  support  the  work  of  occupational 
therapists.    This  research  describes  the  design  of  the 
ArmSleeve  system,  a  patient  monitoring  system  to  support 
therapists  in  their  rehabilitation  work  with  stroke  patients. 
Through  a  design-led 
investigation  with  occupational 
therapists  this  research  offers  an  understanding  of  their 
practices  and  a  set  of  data  that  therapists  desire  about  their 
patients’ activities outside therapy. 

A  second  contribution  is  offered  through  the  design  of  a 
wearable technology, the ArmSleeve sensor, which monitors 
upper  limb  movement  in  daily  life.  Unlike  other  prototypes 
that  present  the  intensity  of  movement  through unprocessed 
accelerometer  data  [6],  the  ArmSleeve  sensor  can  measure 
angular  motion in  three degrees of freedom  at  the  shoulder, 
as  well  as  elbow  extension  and  wrist  supination  and 
pronation. 

Finally,  this  research  contributes  a  dashboard  to  visualize 
upper limb movement for therapists. While recent work has 
provided visualizations for single arm movements to support 
exercise  [29],  our  work  offers  insights  into  visualizing  arm 
movements collected over several weeks in both aggregated 

and  detailed  formats.  Finally,  we  have  shown  how  this 
information  can  provide  therapists  with  insights  into  how 
much  their  patients  engage  their  arm  in  activities  of  daily 
living and exercise.  

Design Implications for Interpreting Sensor Data 
We began this research aiming to help therapists understand 
how much patients use their upper limbs in daily life outside 
therapy.  The  therapists  found  useful  objective  data  on 
ArmSleeve  on  how  much  patients  use  their  upper  limb. 
However, the therapists found it difficult to understand how 
this data relates to the patient’s daily life outside therapy. 

Studies  of  medical  work  show  that  health  data  is  often  not 
self-evident and additional work is required to make sense of 
the data and to apply it in practice. For example, related work 
on  clinicians  interpreting  sensor  data  from  Parkinson’s 
patients  [22]  and  multiple  sclerosis  patients  23]  highlight 
similar  challenges  in  interpreting  sensor  data  in  the  absence 
of  the  patient.  The  work  on  multiple  sclerosis  patients  [24] 
resolved this issue by presenting physiotherapists with video 
recordings of assessment tasks performed by their patients in 
clinical settings alongside with sensor data. This approach is 
not a practical solution for the ArmSleeve system, as it seeks 
to collect data over several weeks. Furthermore, occupational 
therapists are not only interested in clinical assessment tasks, 
but fundamentally in how patients participate in activities of 
daily living like eating, washing and dressing in the context 
of their home or in the community.  

It  is  well  understood  in  HCI  that  contextual  information  is 
crucial for users to make sense of data, yet that it is difficult 
to gather through technology [12]. While sensors can provide 
information  about  the  time  and  place  of  upper  limb 
movement,  understanding  the  intention,  purpose,  quality  as 
well as the outcome of a movement typically relies on human 
intelligence.  In  recent  years  we  have  seen  significant 
improvements in computational efforts to understand human 
action in other domains, e.g., in the interpretation of language 
for  personal  assistants  like  Siri  and  Cortana.  Similar 
directions  are  pursued  in  the  interpretation  of  human 
movements. For example, machine learning has been applied 
to  interpret  upper  limb  motions  of  stroke  patients  to  detect 
activities  like  drinking  and  brushing  hair.  The  Internet  of 
Things  can  provide  clues  about  the  activities  of  people 
through  instrumented  objects  that  people  use  in  their 
activities of daily living, e.g., to recognize whether a person 
is lifting a cup or opening a door [4]. 

In future work we seek a more human-oriented approach in 
our design by engaging patients in the interpretation of sensor 
data. We see merit in the technological approaches discussed 
above to provide contextual clues. However, we believe that 
these  improvements  will  be  partial,  and  understanding  the 
meaning of upper limb motion and its quality will continue to 
rely  on  human  intelligence.  The  therapists  in  this  study 
regarded  the  data  presented  on  the  dashboard  as  an 
opportunity  to  engage  patients  in  a  dialogue  to  learn  more 
about  their  daily  lives.  Activity  diaries  kept  by  patients  can 

Sensing, HealthDIS 2016, June 4–8, 2016, Brisbane, Australia708enrich  this  dialogue  and  help  to  make  sense  of  the  data 
presented on the dashboard. 

Engagement between therapists and patients is not merely a 
means to interpret sensor data, but it can be an end in itself. 
The  therapists  found  that  the  dashboard  provides  an 
for  mutual  understanding  and  empathy. 
opportunity 
Therapists  can  use  the  dashboard  data  to  probe  patients  to 
learn more about their everyday lives and the challenges they 
may  face.  Conversely,  the  dashboard  provides  patients  with 
an  opportunity  to  learn  about  their  treatment  and  their 
progress, and it can help them to stay motivated.  

It  is  important  to  note  that  such  a  participatory  approach  in 
the interpretation of sensor data is not without its challenges. 
Patients  can  offer  expertise  through  their  lived  experience 
with the effects of stroke, but clinicians can overshadow such 
dialogue due to established hierarchies, clinical expertise and 
experience  in  interpreting  sensor  data  [22].  It  is  also 
important  to  keep  in  mind  that  taking  on  responsibility  for 
self-monitoring  and  interpreting  data  can  be  a  burden  [21], 
and  not  every  patient  may  be  able  to  or  desire  such 
involvement.  Hence  in  future  work  we  seek  to  work  with 
patients  who  wish  to  be  more  actively  engaged  in  their 
therapy. Through the design of ArmSleeve  we hope to give 
these  patients  an  opportunity  to  better  understand  their 
progress  and  to  become  empowered  in  their  collaboration 
with therapists to achieve their desired therapy outcome. 

Design Implications for Sensors Worn in Daily Life 
We  also  began  this  research  with  the  ambition  of  designing 
sensor technology that stroke patients can  wear in  everyday 
life.  While  we  have  presented  a  working  prototype, 
considerable work is required to develop the sensors further 
into a system that these patients can use in daily life.  

A major design issue is the “wearability” [14] of the sensor 
technology to ensure it is usable and provides comfort. A key 
question  that  we  need  to  address  is  the  placement  of  the 
sensor on the body, i.e., to ensure accurate data and comfort 
when  worn  over  extended  periods  of  time.  Minimizing  the 
size  and  weight  of  the  device  is  also  critical  to  increase 
comfort.  Further  critical  issues  are  the  containment  of  the 
sensor and how it is attached to the body. This is to ensure it 
fits  the  shape  of  the  different  parts  of  the  upper  limb,  both 
when a patient is static as well as when she is moving. This is 
also  important  because  patients  or  their  caretakers  need  to 
find  it  easy  to  don  and  take  off  the  sensor  for  charging  the 
device,  or  for  sleeping  and  washing.  These  issues  are 
particularly important as our intention is for these devices to 
be  worn  over  several  days  or  weeks  by  people  with 
impairments to their mobility and sensation. 

A  second  design  issue  is  the  modularity  of  the  sensor 
technology.  The  current  system  consists  of  three  sensor 
modules,  which  can  monitor  shoulder  movement  in  three 
degrees  of  freedom,  as  well  as  elbow  extension  and  wrist 

rotation.  While  this  setup  is  useful  for  patients  working  on 
improving  upper  arm  movement,  studies  1  and  3  also 
highlighted  that  there  is  considerable  variability  between 
patients. For example, a patient with hemispatial neglect may 
only  require  a  single  sensor  module  at  the  wrist  to  detect  if 
the  arm  is  moved  at  all  and  if  it  crosses  the  midline.  Other 
patients,  however,  may  benefit  from  sensors  that  capture 
wrist  extension  and  finger  movement,  as  these  motions  are 
critical  to  perform  activities  of  daily  living  [27].  Hence  in 
future work we seek to extend the range of motions that we 
can  monitor with ArmSleeve.  At the same  time, we seek to 
explore  how  we  can  create  modules  of  sensor  units  that 
collect  data  about  a  particular  joint  and  motion  of  interest, 
and thereby minimize the amount of technology that needs to 
be worn. 

issues 

to  develop  an  understanding  of 

We  now  seek  to  engage  with  patients  in  exploring  these 
design 
their 
perspective on ArmSleeve and elaborate its design. It is well 
known  that  medical  devices  are  often  rejected  due  to  the 
stigma attached to it [17]. While the therapists  in  this study 
were confident that many patients would find such a system 
useful,  we  aim  to  work  with  patients  directly  in  future 
iterations, to  learn about possible benefits  and any concerns 
they may have about accountability and privacy. 

CONCLUSION 
We  have  worked  with  occupational  therapists  to  build  and 
evaluate  the  ArmSleeve  system,  which  monitors  the  upper 
limb  movements  of  stroke  patients  outside  therapy.  This 
design-led  investigation  has  shown  that  in  order  for  therapy 
to be effective, patients need to engage their arm in exercise 
and  other  activities  consistently  throughout  their  daily  life. 
The  ArmSleeve  sensor  prototype  collects  such  patient  data 
through  a  wearable  technology  worn  on  the  arm.  The 
ArmSleeve  dashboard  offers  visualizations  of  the  number, 
quality and range of arm movements over several weeks. 

The  evaluation  of  the  ArmSleeve  system  demonstrated  that 
therapists benefit from this system through insights into how 
much  their  patients  use  their  upper  limb  outside  therapy. 
However,  it  also  highlighted  a  discrepancy  between  the 
motion  data  presented  by  the  system,  and  the  insights  into 
activities  of  daily  living  that  therapists  desired.  Based  on 
ArmSleeve  data  alone,  therapists  were  unsure  whether 
movement  related  to  exercise,  activities  of  daily  living,  or 
simply a patient swinging the arm while walking.  

In future work we seek to address this issue through engaging 
both patients and therapists into a dialogue to collaboratively 
interpret the data. While the work to date has focused on the 
therapist,  we  now  also  seek  to  work  with  patients  to  refine 
the  dashboard  and  the  sensors  into  a  system  that  can  be 
tailored to the needs of a patient and used seamlessly in daily 
living. Our vision is a system that fosters dialogue between a 
patient  and  their  therapist,  and  which  enhances  mutual 
understanding and empathy.
