ABSTRACT 
Recent  research  examines  how  and  why  people  abandon 
self-tracking tools. We extend this work with new insights 
drawn from people reflecting on their experiences after they 
stop tracking, examining how designs continue to influence 
people  even  after  abandonment.  We  further  contrast  prior 
work  considering  abandonment  of  health  and  wellness 
tracking  tools  with  an  exploration  of  why  people  abandon 
financial  and  location  tracking  tools,  and  we  connect  our 
findings  to  models  of  personal  informatics.  Surveying  193 
people and interviewing 12 people, we identify six reasons 
why people stop tracking and five perspectives on life after 
tracking.  We  discuss  these  results  and  opportunities  for 
design to consider life after self-tracking.

INTRODUCTION 
Personal informatics is defined as the process of collecting 
and  reflecting  on  personal  information  [12],  and  is  now  a 
common practice in the lives of many people [7]. However, 
people over time come to temporarily lapse or permanently 
discontinue self-tracking [4,5,6,11]. We study abandonment 
of self-tracking tools to gain insight into how to design tools 
that: (1) better align with tracking objectives and practices, 
and (2) support better abandonment experiences. 

This  paper  extends  current  understanding  of  abandonment 
with  insights  drawn  from  people  reflecting  on  their 
experiences after they stopped self-tracking. As part of this, 
we  examine  how  designs  can  continue  to  influence  people 
even  after  abandonment.  We  extend  recent  work  examining 
self-tracking technology abandonment in health and wellness 
[4,5,11]  by  contrasting  it  with  abandonment  in  other 
self-tracking domains, specifically finance and location. We

frame these findings in models of how people use personal 
informatics  tools  [6,12],  and  we  identify  and  discuss  how 
self-tracking barriers lead to abandonment. 

We survey 193 people who formerly tracked their physical 
activity,  finances,  or  location,  conduct  12  interviews,  and 
distill  themes  from  this  qualitative  data.  We  extend  prior 
work by identifying six reasons people stop tracking and five 
perspectives  on  life  after  tracking  among  the  three  studied 
domains. Our results contribute to a growing understanding 
of  self-tracking  abandonment,  and surface opportunities for 
design to consider life after tracking. 

BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 
To characterize how people use self-tracking tools, Li et al. 
introduce a five-stage model of personal informatics, which 
emphasizes  barriers  to  tracking  toward  a  goal of reflection 
and presumed action [12]. This model has been modified and 
expanded, noting people can reflect on data [3] and ultimately 
change  habits  [16]  in  the  midst  of  tracking.  Epstein et al. 
characterize challenges in lived informatics [14], developing a 
model of tool use in everyday life that surfaces lapsing and 
stopping as major components [6]. 

Avoiding or discontinuing the use of technology is common 
practice. Baumer et al. enumerate motivations for not using 
Facebook,  including  concerns  for  data  use  and  privacy  as 
well  as  avoiding  addiction  [2].  In  the  domains  of  physical 
activity and health and wellness more broadly, recent work 
has  explored  reasons  people  stop  using  self-tracking  tools. 
Schwanda et al. interview people using Wii Fit, finding they 
begin other exercise activities and abandon the technology, 
regarding the abandonment as a success [15]. Clawson et al. 
extend this “happy abandonment,” suggesting designs should 
support people who no longer feel the need to track [4]. Tools 
sometimes  satisfy  people’s  curiosity  about  their  habits, 
rendering  tracking  no  longer  important  [6,11].  People  find 
tools frustrating or time-consuming, ultimately not worth the 
time investment [5,11]. We extend and contrast such findings 
in  the  domains  of  finance  and  location,  building  a  broader 
understanding of abandoning tracking. 

DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS 
We conducted a series of surveys using Amazon Mechanical 
Turk with people from the United States who had completed 
at least 1,000 HITs with a 95% acceptance rate. To identify 
people who had previously tracked, participants completed a 
2-minute  screener  survey  ($0.50  compensation).  Of  640 

Living Healthy#chi4good, CHI 2016, San Jose, CA, USA1109 
 
 
completed  surveys,  we  identified  133,  101,  and  91  people 
who had tracked their physical activity, finances, and location 
(271  unique  people).  We  then  conducted  two  follow-up 
surveys  (screened  participants  could  take  either).  The  first 
examined  self-tracking  abandonment  practices,  requiring 
about  five  minutes  ($1.00  compensation).  The  second 
emphasized  life  after  tracking,  requiring  about  10  minutes 
($2.00  compensation).  Of  people  who  tracked  physical 
activity,  finances,  and  location,  64,  61,  and  50  people 
completed  the  first  follow-up  survey,  and  68,  56,  and  42 
people completed the second. 193 unique people (aged 18-
63, mean 31.6) completed at least one survey, including 109 
male, 82 female, and 2 people who declined to report gender. 
Length of tool use varied substantially, ranging from less than 
a  week  to  over  two  years.  49%  had  used  more  than  one 
tracking tool (average 1.7 tools used). Additional details and 
survey materials are in the online appendix. 

Based  on  responses  to  the  first  survey,  we  invited  34 
respondents  to  participate  in  an  interview,  targeting  people 
with either particularly representative or unique experiences, 
yielding  6  interviewees.  We  supplemented  these  with  6 
interviewees  recruited 
through  a  convenience  sample 
(university mailing lists and social network posts), for a total 
of 12 (4 male, 8 female). Interviews lasted about an hour, and 
interviewees were compensated $20. 

Four  researchers  used  open  coding  to  identify  themes  in 
responses  and  transcripts.  Two  then  coded  independently, 
discussing  and  refining  codes  to  reach  high  agreement 
(Cohen’s Kappa 0.74 to 1.0 for 11 codes). We quote survey 
participants with pXX, and interview participants with iXX. 

WHY PEOPLE STOP TRACKING 
Participants in our study, especially those who had tracked 
for health and wellness, stopped using their tools for many 
of  the  reasons  identified  in  prior  research.  We  also  found 
reasons not previously identified, especially among trackers 
in other domains. We ground our discussion of why  people 
stop tracking in models of personal informatics [12] and lived 
informatics  [6],  and  contrast  our  findings  with  prior  work. 
These  categories  do  not  cover  all  the  reasons  people  stop 
tracking  (e.g.,  tools  break,  people  switch  phones  [14]),  but 
capture the most prominent themes we found in our data. 

Cost  of  collecting  and  integrating.  The  cost  of  tracking 
often leads to abandonment, consistent with prior health and 
wellness results [4,5,11]. People find tracking “a hassle,” feel 
“lazy,”  or  “lose  interest”  and  stop  tracking  (20,  16,  and  6 
people). The habit of collecting data can often be difficult to 
maintain in tools that require regular manual entry, such as 
financial spreadsheets or food journals [5,6]: “I got behind on 
keeping up with it and couldn’t find the time to start back up” 
(p112, 18 others). Others find tracking too tiring “I got burnt 
out on [keeping a financial spreadsheet]” (p14). 

Cost of having or sharing the data. 45.2% of respondents 
who stopped tracking location did so due to concerns for data 
sharing.  This  surfaces  within  Li  et  al.’s  model  as  part  of 

integration between the location data collected and the social 
context in which it is shared [12]. Although concerns with 
regard to privacy in location tracking and sharing are well-
documented  [1,13],  we  note  a  connection  between  sharing 
concerns  and  abandonment  of  location  self-tracking.  People 
were  concerned  about  what  friends  could  see  “I  don’t  want 
people knowing where I am all the time” (p161, 11 others) as 
well as companies using information about them “I don’t want 
a record of my activities being reviewed or sold to try to sell me 
better  ads”  (p61,  6  others).  Although  these  concerns  were 
largely expressed by people tracking location, emerging new 
domains  (e.g.,  biometric  data  such  as  heart  rate  or  blood 
pressure) may present similar concerns, especially as more 
personal informatics tools rely on cloud storage or processing. 

Discomfort  with  information  revealed.  During  reflection, 
tracking can highlight perceived shortcomings in behavior or 
behavior  change,  and  people  can  find  this  uncomfortable. 
p133 “didn’t like being so aware of how little money I had,” 
while p178 stopped tracking because she “had to witness my 
weight  fluctuations  every  day.”  For  p163,  entering  new 
expenses was unpleasant: “I felt guilty every time I tracked 
an  expense  that  was  not  a  necessity.”  Prior  work has  found 
food journals can feel judgmental when people exceed their 
calorie budgets [5]. We extend this finding, noting that tools 
in other domains can create feelings of judgment. 

Abandoning tracking may be the easiest way to address this 
tracking  because  she  “felt 
discomfort.  p23  stopped 
discouraged  with  my  lack  of  progress”  and  p3  “didn't  feel 
like  I  was  getting  the  results  that  I  wanted.”  Tracking 
emphasized the difficulty of p144’s circumstances and made 
her feel even worse about her situation: “the decision to stop 
tracking  made  me  very  sad,  like  it  was  the  final  thing  in 
admitting  how  bad  my  [financial]  situation  had  become.” 
When people do not feel tools help them act to change the 
situation, tracking may only add to their frustration. 

Data quality concerns. People often desire greater accuracy 
than their tools provide [12]: “the calories burnt seemed so 
random, and didn’t line up with other online sources” (p123, 
19 others), or find data unreliable “the GPS would lose my 
location  and  stop  tracking  my  run”  (p139),  leading  to 
imperfect  personal  data.  This  problem  in  collection  inhibits 
effective reflection and consequently action. 

Learned enough. People often begin tracking to learn their 
habits, with a goal of action [6,12]. Moreover, Rooksby et al. 
find  people  track  over  short-term  periods  in  support  of 
long-term  goals  [14].  We  also  found  this  practice  in  our 
participants. Six people felt no reason to continue tracking 
after learning what they needed in order to act: “I was very 
familiar  with  the  different  routes  I  was  taking  when  I  was 
running, so I eventually just sort of phased out MapMyRun. 
It  wasn’t  beneficial  to  me  anymore”  (p20).  After  people 
develop a skill, the potential benefits of tracking change and 
it  can  become  unnecessary.  p29  “was  able  to  figure  my 
distance and calories burned without [MapMyRun]” and p89 
“was able to keep track [of my finances] in my head.” 

Living Healthy#chi4good, CHI 2016, San Jose, CA, USA1110 
 
People  also  track  to  develop  and  adhere  to  plans,  such  as 
exercise, weight loss, or budgets [6,8,9,10]. Although helpful 
in developing a plan, some people find that “once I had that 
plan, the Fitbit was no longer necessary” (p171, 5 others). 
p146  “felt  that  I  could  take  charge  of  keeping  my  own 
lifestyle” and thought tracking was no longer required. 

Life circumstances change. As noted in the lived informatics 
model,  lives  and  routines  may  change,  leading  people  to 
intentionally or unintentionally suspend tracking [6]. People 
regularly  change  their  activities  to  ones  their  existing 
tracking  tools  do  not  support,  such  as  p115  who  “gave  up 
running  and  started  to  do  other  types  of  exercise.”  p127 
“moved to an area that did not have a good walking trail” 
and “had to switch to indoor activity and MapMyRun isn’t 
great for that.” Other life events may force people to give up 
the activity they tracked, such as for p17 “I became pregnant 
and was not able to exercise anymore because my pregnancy 
was  high  risk,”  p181  “I  stopped  riding  my  bike  due  to  a 
serious  injury,”  and  8  others.  Other  life  events  often  take 
priority over keeping up with tracking, such as for p133, who 
used to track finances and then “got divorced and had other 
things to focus on.” 

Some people described stopping tracking finances when they 
did not have any money to track. For i1, “it came to a point 
where as soon as I had money it had to immediately go to pay 
for something that was needed, so there really wasn’t anything 
to keep track of.” These were often caused by unemployment 
“I  lost  my  job  and  my  income  dropped”  (p109,  5  others)  or 
career  changes  “I  went  to  grad  school  and  thus  had  no 
income” (p82, 5 others). However, stopping tracking can also 
signal  an  improving  financial  situation,  such  as  for  p50 
“I was out of debt and making good money” (2 others). 

LIFE AFTER TRACKING 
People  had  varied  opinions  and  feelings  about  abandoning 
tracking.  Table  1  shows  the  relationship  between  reasons  for 
abandonment and perspectives on life after tracking reported 
by participants in our second survey. Percentages correspond 
to agreement between the two coders. 

No  major  effect.  Interest  in  tracking  often  faded  without 
leaving a strong impression, especially for people who felt 
the  cost  of  tracking  was  too  high  to  continue.  People 
described  this  perspective  across  all  three  of  the  tracking 
domains  we  surveyed.  i7  used  MapMyRun,  but  “I  didn’t 
think  about  it  until  your  survey,  that  actually  was  when  I 
remembered,  ‘Yeah,  I  did  do  that.’”  Some  people,  such  as 
p55 and 5 others, started to track out of curiosity but were 
not  particularly  invested  in  the  activity:  “I  felt  indifferent 
about [tracking] because I wasn’t that into trying to increase 
my  physical  activity.”  Like  p55,  most  who  started  out  of 
curiosity and later abandoned tracking then feel indifferent 
about  their  experience.  p110  stopped  tracking  his  location 
because he “simply forgot to do so,” and he had few thoughts 
about his tracking experiences: “I don’t feel bad. I don’t feel 
much about it.  It just kind of happened.”

Frustration.  Tracking  tools  often  do  not  match  people’s 
expectations  [4].  After  abandonment,  some  people  remain 
frustrated  with  their  lack  of  success  tracking  and  attribute 
that frustration differently. Some felt frustrated with the cost 
of  tracking  [11],  as  witsh  p57  who  stopped  using  a  Fitbit: 
“I feel  more  frustrated  than  anything…  I  want  to  track  my 
data. I just would rather it be effortless.” Others felt frustrated 
that a situation outside their control prevented tracking: “it 
was frustrating to know that I needed to make time to do the 
tracking,  but  the  needs  of  my  family  outweighed  my  own 
personal goals” (p23 and 4 others). As tool design evolves and 
lives change, people may decide to return. Similar to people 
interviewed by Lazar et al. [11], 16 people planned to return, 
including p19: “I’m ok with my decision to stop, but I do think 
that I will probably do it again in the future.” 

Frustration with the effectiveness of tracking was uncommon 
among financial and location trackers in our study. This may 
be  because  location  trackers  typically  start  tracking  out  of 
curiosity  rather  than  a  desire  to  change  habits  [6],  while 
financial trackers often want a financial touch (e.g., awareness 
of current status) [10]. Because they did not initially anticipate 
action, they may be less frustrated by abandonment. 

Guilt. Some people feel guilty for not making tracking a habit, 
though they found the cost of tracking too high to continue. 
This  was  also  more  common  among  people  who  started 
tracking  with  the  intent  of  changing  physical  activity 
(16.2% of  people  who  tracked  activity)  or  financial  habits 
(8.9%  of  people  who  tracked  finances).  i11  tried  to  use  a 
spreadsheet  to  track  her  finances,  stopped,  and  eventually 
“started  feeling  guilty…  I  shouldn’t  have  stopped  finance 
tracking.” She eventually tried to use Mint, but stopped again. 
She still feels guilty about stopping: “I really should get back

to using this or something similar again… I ought to be doing 
something like this. So yes, guilt.” 

People often blame themselves for not continuing to track, 
particularly in physical activity. p87 stated, “I feel like I am 
wasting  my  potential  by  not  keeping  on  top  of  tracking,” 
while  p116  felt  “regret  because  I  could  have  seen  my 
progress or lack thereof over time.” p188 stopped tracking 
his activity because “at the time I thought I could handle it 
on my own.” He was sadly unsuccessful: “I regret it deeply. 
My workouts have suffered if I do them and most weeks I do 
not.” A few felt guilty for abandoning tracking after a change 
in  life  circumstances  (5.9%  and  5.4%  of  people  no  longer 
tracking physical activity or finances): p97 got sick, stopped 
tracking her activity, and now feels “ashamed that I haven’t 
restarted, because I was doing so well.” 

Freedom.  Self-tracking  can  be  time-consuming,  difficult, 
and “more of a hassle than a pleasure” (p65). Some are glad 
to  be  done,  even  if  they  were  not  successful.  For p52, 
financial tracking “felt more and more cumbersome … it used 
up a fair bit of my time.” Ceasing tracking “felt like a burden 
was lifted off of me. Although I wanted to continue tracking, 
I felt this was the right decision… I wanted some of my free 
time  back.”  A  few  people  who  stopped  after  they  learned 
enough  felt  free  from  needing  to  track.  After  i10  felt  she 
understood  her  spending,  she  “was  able  to  quit.”  p163 
avoided the guilt tracking caused and still successfully kept 
her budget: “I feel that I am still able to stay within my budget 
while no longer feeling guilty for any of my purchases that 
are not necessities.” 

Location trackers most commonly felt free from tracking their 
data,  particularly  those  who  had  concerns  about  having  or 
sharing data (33.3% of people surveyed). p18 felt free from 
friends knowing, “I feel like I can move around freely without 
everyone  knowing  my  every  move,”  while  p25  appreciated 
freedom from businesses tracking him: “I didn’t like thinking 
that outside agencies could see my location tracking and it 
made me feel very exposed.” p188 found tracking his location 
encouraged  bad  habits:  “I  NEEDED  to  be  the  mayor  of 
places that were important to me so I spent more time there 
than I needed to and spent more money… it had turned into 
a stress rather than something fun.” Abandoning freed him 
from the added stress of competition. 

Continued  use  of  knowledge  or  skills.  Many  people 
internalize habits developed when tracking and continue to 
apply their knowledge after abandonment. Financial trackers 
such as p45 and 11 others learned their spending habits and 
no  longer  needed  to  track:  “I  knew  that  I  could  spend 
wisely… my finances are still good, and I haven’t had any 
issues because I’ve stopped tracking.” p135 stopped tracking 
her physical activity because she “had a very good idea of the 
amount  of  steps  I  was  taking  without  the  app…  I  knew 
without the app if I was accomplishing my goal.” 

Tracking helps others make structural changes to their lives. 
p118 “set a budget that I now carefully follow,” and felt “the 

financial tracking software I used are like training wheels. I 
used the training wheels to develop balance. It was time for 
the training wheels to come off.” p89 changed her habits and 
felt tracking was no longer important: “I made changes to my 
spending and did not need to keep close tabs… I have kept 
up  with  my  changes  and  am  still  doing  well.”  p40  started 
tracking because he “had a goal of being able to run a 5K 
without stopping.” He “felt tracking did its job” and stopped, 
but is “still running 5K’s when I can.” 

People successfully use tracking to change habits, and some 
feel  that  continuing  to  track  is  unnecessary  to  sustain  the 
change. 7.1% of respondents no longer tracking their finances 
reported using knowledge they gained from tracking, despite 
stopping tracking due to data collection barriers. This suggests 
reflection  and  action  can  occur  long  after  people  abandon 
data collection. Abandonment is thus not always indicative 
of failure nor the successful end of a process, but could rather 
be a sign of diminishing returns or a redefinition of goals. 

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
Self-tracking is not an effective or beneficial experience for 
everyone.  Many  recall  their  tracking  experience  with 
indifference, as just another piece of technology that did not 
fit in their lives. Others feel frustration that tracking did not 
support their goals and blame either themselves or the tools. 
Still others feel guilty for abandoning tracking and wish they 
had  found  the  will  or  time  to  resume.  Designers  should 
explore how to appropriately facilitate reengagement and how 
designs can support a more successful experience in returning. 
i8  stopped  using  Mint  five  years  ago,  yet  “I still  get  emails 
from  [Mint]  that  I  ignore…  I  don’t  care  about  them.” 
Perhaps  tracking  tools  can  promote  programs  tailored  to 
resuming tracking (e.g., restarting physical activity), rather 
than nagging notifications pointing out a lack of tracking. 

Models of personal informatics in everyday life further include 
the process of deciding to track and selecting a tool [6,12]. 
Our participants had all tried tracking, but we believe many 
people  consider  tracking  and abandon  the  idea  before  ever 
starting.  Future  work  should  study  why  people  abandon 
tracking before  they  start, which  may  inform  better  design 
for decisions about whether to track and which tool to use. 

We contribute an understanding of life after tracking. Having 
tracked has no lasting effect for some people, while others 
continue to apply the lessons they learned about their habits 
or  how  to  act.  For  others,  tracking  was  a  frustrating 
experience they wished fit better into their lives. Some felt 
guilty  about  stopping,  while  others  felt  free  from  the 
burdensome  or  invasive  activity  of  tracking.  We  surface 
tracking, 
to  design  for 
open  opportunities 
promoting happy abandonment, and designing tools to best 
support people who want to return to tracking.
