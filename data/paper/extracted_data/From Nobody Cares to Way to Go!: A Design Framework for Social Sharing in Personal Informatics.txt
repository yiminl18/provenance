ABSTRACT 
Many  research  applications  and  popular  commercial 
applications include features for sharing personally collected 
data with others in social awareness streams. Prior work has 
identified  several  barriers  to  use  as  well  as  discrepancies 
between designer goals and how these features are used in 
practice.  We  develop  a  framework  for  designing  and 
evaluating  these  features  based  on  an  extensive  review  of 
prior literature. We demonstrate the value of this framework 
by  analyzing  physical  activity  sharing  on  Twitter,  coding 
4,771 tweets and their responses and gathering 444 reactions 
from  97  potential  tweet  recipients,  learning  that  specific 
user-generated content leads to more responses and is better 
received by the post audience. We conclude by extending our 
findings to other sharing problems and discussing the value 
of our design framework.

INTRODUCTION 
Technological devices and applications for tracking personal 
data have become increasingly ubiquitous. The motivations 
for tracking vary by application and person, from curiosity 
and fascination with data [32] to having a record [19,33,36] 
to  motivating  behavior  change  [19,42]  to  engaging  with 
others [3,24,46]. 

Many  applications,  both  research  (e.g.  [11,15,27,35])  and 
commercial  (e.g.,  FitBit,  Spotify,  FourSquare),  have 
integrated  features  for  sharing  this  data  with  others. 
Considerable research attention has been paid to sharing with 
others  who  have  similar  goals  or  who  are  in  the  same 
situation (referred to in this paper as peer support networks). 
In  particular,  research  has  considered  online  support 
communities [26,51] and in-application comparison features 
[11,56], and has identified several best practices [47]. This

form of sharing specifically articulates a set of friends who 
will  share  data  with  each  other.  Within  the  group,  known 
individuals directly share information with each other. 

A second form of sharing – sharing through social awareness 
streams (SAS) such as timelines and newsfeeds in Twitter or 
Facebook – is also commonly used in practice. The use of 
SAS is a more indirect form of sharing amongst individuals 
who  may  or  may  not  be  known  to  each  other.  Sharing 
personal  informatics  data  (defined  by  Li  et  al.  as  personal 
information collected for self-reflection [32]) through SAS 
can  help  people  reach  friends,  family,  acquaintances, 
coworkers  and  others  with  whom  they  wish  to  stay 
connected. People who collect and post personal informatics 
data (referred to in this paper as sharers) often hope to gain 
emotional support or communicate their identity as someone 
engaged  in  these  activities  [20,24,44,55].  This  form  of 
sharing  can  also  help  identify  potential  activity  partners 
[18,42],  create  sources  of  accountability  and  motivation 
[43,44], and elicit advice from people who know them and 
their context [44,51]. 

Despite  reported  interest  in  and  a  prevalence  of  features 
supporting sharing personal data through SAS, these features 
often find limited or problematic use. While usage data from 
commercial  systems  is  hard  to  obtain,  the  record  from 
research  literature  is  clear:  most  study  participants  ignore 
social sharing features, have concerns that prevent their use, 
or are disappointed by the reactions they receive when they 
are  used  [35,37,42,56].  Prior  work  (e.g.,  [11,35,42])  has 
identified several barriers to their use, including not wanting 
to share a trivial accomplishment and feeling uncomfortable 
sharing with an unfamiliar audience. Other work has pointed 
out the importance of finding an appropriate audience [21] 
or that the responsibility of choosing to ignore or engage with 
shared content is left to the recipient [55]. 

In this paper, we reconcile the gap between social sharers’ 
aspirations  and  their  actual  behaviors  and  outcomes.  We 
develop a descriptive framework of social sharing research, 
consolidating  findings 
identifying 
underexplored design alternatives. We demonstrate the value 
of  this  framework  by  using  a  subset  of  the  dimensions  to 
analyze how and why people use one popular application to 
share physical activity information on Twitter and how the 
details  of  the  sharing  affect  responses.  We  consider 
perspectives of both sharers and their audiences, conducting

on 

Specifically, we address the following questions: 

RQ1: What design space of social sharing has been explored 
by  prior  research  and  practice  in  personal  informatics  and 
what conclusions can be drawn from this body of work? 

RQ2: How do self-trackers presently share physical activity 
data in SAS, and how do recipients respond to seeing posts 
with this content? 

RQ3: How do potential recipients feel about seeing this data 
in  SAS,  and  what  content  features  elicit  replies  or  other 
positive reactions? 

In  the  remainder  of  this  paper,  we  review  motivations  and 
benefits  associated  with  social  sharing,  the  ways  in  which 
systems  support  this  form  of  sharing,  and  how  well  these 
features support sharers’ goals and how they break down. To 
support  our  discussion,  we  draw  on  prior  work  on  people 
who socially share personal informatics data and an analysis 
of  tweets  from  the  popular  fitness  application  RunKeeper. 
We  conclude  by  discussing  possible  implications  of  these 
findings  for  other  sharing  domains  within  personal 
informatics. 

SOCIALLY SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATICS DATA 
While the majority of personal informatics research focuses 
on  helping  individuals  improve  themselves  by  reducing 
barriers to collecting and making sense of data, research and 
commercial  applications  have  included  features  to  share 
collected  data  with  others.  In  this  paper,  we  consider  the 
sharing of self-tracked data to online social networks with a 
target audience of friends and family. 

Many  systems  support  symmetric  sharing  among  groups 
[4,26,51] or pairs [40] in peer support networks. With peer 
groups,  people  can  receive  and  offer  experience-based 
advice,  identify  mentors  and  other  motivators,  and  have  a 
sense of shared experience. The audience – other members 
of the group – has personal experience with the sort the data 
shared. This helps people share it without needing to provide 
much  additional  context  about  the  data.  Sharing  with  peer 
strangers,  on  the  other  hand,  may  mean  that  they  have  to 
provide additional context about themselves. 

Sharing  personal  informatics  data  through  SAS  creates 
opportunities not possible in peer support networks, such as 
reaching  an  audience  of  people  whose  opinions  matter  for 
emotional  support.  However,  this  space  has  challenges 
distinct from those in peer support networks, such as how to 
frame  data  for  an  audience  potentially  unfamiliar  with  the 
domain or goals. We continue to compare sharing personal 
informatics  data  through  SAS  to  peer  support  networks 

throughout  this  paper,  but  focus  on  design  issues  and 
opportunities for SAS. 

Why people share 
People  have  many  reasons  for  sharing  their  personal 
informatics data with peers and with their support networks 
of  friends,  family,  and  colleagues  [41].  In  many  domains, 
such  as  health,  social  support  is  an  important  factor  in 
behavior  change  [31,51].  In  this  section,  we  review  the 
reasons for social sharing in personal informatics identified 
in prior work, including sharing intended to support behavior 
change and other uses of the data. 

Request for information 
Many  people  share  their  data  and  experiences  to  receive 
some form of information from their audience. People turn 
to their social networks for recommendations, advice on how 
to improve, or for something new to try [39,44,51]. This is a 
common practice in – and often the expressed goal of – peer 
support networks, as the audience has a shared experience to 
draw upon and offer recommendations from [26,51]. 

Desire for emotional support 
Sharers also seek emotional support, both from peers going 
through  a  similar  experience  and  from  caring  friends  and 
family [44,51]. For example, the HeartLink system enabled 
a  social  network  to  cheer  on  participants  running  a  race, 
which  participants  found  motivating  [15].  In  controlled 
studies, participants enjoyed receiving and felt motivated by 
encouraging messages sent from others in the study [11,56]. 

Seeking motivation or accountability from audience 
Sharers may seek motivation and accountability by making 
commitments public, identifying potential activity partners, 
or creating competitions [42,44]. Collaborating in a shared 
activity  can  create  a  source  of  accountability  [40].  Some 
people  post  their  plans  and  goals  to  Twitter  to  create  a 
commitment mechanism that helps motivate them to remain 
active and achieve their goals [55]. 

Motivating or informing the sharing audience 
Some people also strive to motivate or inform their audience 
by  sharing  their  experiences  collecting  personal  data  [10]. 
People  also  share  records  of  activities  and  goals,  such  as 
eating  healthy  or  exercising,  to  motivate  others  to  act 
similarly  [7].  In  location-sharing  applications,  people  may 
broadcast  their  location  to  recommend  a  cool  place  they 
found or to potentially meet up with nearby friends [36]. 

Impression management 
People use social sharing to communicate an identity to their 
social networks and achieve impression management goals 
[20,44],  but  this  also  leads  to  curation  and  concerns  about 
self-presentation [44,58]. Posts about runs or workouts can 
communicate that the sharer is an active, fit individual; feeds 
of  music  can  communicate  one’s  tastes.  This  also  creates 
challenges;  for  example,  people  may  curate  their  music 
listening histories to remove guilty pleasures [50].

DEVELOPING A DESIGN FRAMEWORK 
While  substantial  prior  work  has  explored  social  sharing 
within  personal  informatics,  it  remains  disparate  and 
unorganized. Systems share data in a multitude of ways, but 
system  evaluations  often  lack  integration  with  other  prior 
work because each evaluation focuses on a single approach 
to data sharing. We develop a design framework by looking 
across  many  different  studies,  integrating  and  synthesizing 
results.  

The  framework  can  facilitate  analysis  of  new  sharing 
features  by  isolating  a  single  design  choice  to  vary  in 
evaluation. We describe these different design choices along 
several  dimensions,  discussing  factors  of  social  sharing 
across  one  dimension.  The  six  dimensions  developed  and 
discussed are: 
•  Data Domain: the type of data collected and shared 
•  Preprocessing: transformations applied prior to sharing 
•  Sharing Trigger: what causes the data to be shared 
•  Persistence: how long the share is visible 
•  Post Content: what information is shared 
•  Audience: who receives the post 

We  summarize  these  dimensions  and  a  selection  of  prior 
work representing them in Table 1. These dimensions were 
created 
though  a  bottom-up  consideration  of  related 
literature;  three  members  of  the  research  team  categorized 
and  named  identified  dimensions.  While  the  literature 
surveyed  is  not  exhaustive,  it  represents  some  of  the  most 
seminal and influential work on this topic in the CSCW and 
HCI  communities.  We  believe  that  other  prior  work  and 
future  work  on  shared  personal  informatics  data  can  be 
categorized according to these dimensions. 

Data Domain 
Self-tracking occurs in a wide variety of domains as people 
look to quantify various aspects of their lives. Many systems 
have been built to examine physical activity [11,35,38,56], 
bioinformatics  data  such  as  heart  rate  and  ECG  data 
[15,16,40,49], 
location  [6,27,54],  ecologically  friendly 
activities  [22,37],  and  music  [20,50].  These  domains  are 
tracked for a variety of reasons, including to make healthier 
decisions  or  track  health  factors  [8,38,41,55]  or  simply  to 
know thyself [19,32,33]. 

Others  have  studied  the  use  of  commercial  applications 
across  these  domains  as  well.  Location  sharing  has  been 
studied in FourSquare [14,36] and Google Latitude [46], now 
integrated into Google+. Teodoro and Naaman report on the 
use of Twitter to share physical activity [55] while Fritz et al. 
[21] and Rooksby et al. [48] consider other sharing networks. 
Last.fm  has  been  studied  for  how  people  share  music 
listening practices [20,50]. 

When deciding what is appropriate to share, designers should 
consider the norms attached to that type of data. For example, 
biometric  data  is  perhaps  more  personal  than  someone’s 
music listening history, and thus is more influenced by other 

dimensions. Sharing hourly data about music listening might 
be acceptable, while this might be an invasion of privacy for 
biometric data. 

Preprocessing 
Personal  informatics  data  can  go  through  a  series  of 
transformations  prior  to  sharing,  such  as  filtering  or 
aggregating by time. Some systems immediately share raw 
data as it is collected [7,15,18,20,40,46], while others share 
aggregate daily totals [7,11,18,35,42,56]. Other times, shares 
communicate  achievement  of  a  specific  goal  or  milestone 
[42]. Sharing high level syntheses from the raw data has been 
considered, such as a sentence describing a trend in activity 
[19] or a story drawn from collected data [23]. 

Preprocessing of data occurs for a variety of reasons. One is 
to  maintain  privacy,  as  aggregation  can  hide  potentially 
private events, such as specific purchases. Social sharing has 
considered transforming raw data prior to sharing [18,29,30]. 
Designers  of  other  systems  have  discussed  electing  not  to 
disclose  potentially  sensitive  events  [37]  or  sharing  less 
specific  information  (e.g.  a  generic  place  like  “Grocery 
Store” or city-level information) [3,12,54]. 

Preprocessing  data  can  also  prevent  inundating  recipients 
with large amounts of data or frequent posts. Prior work on 
physical  activity  tracking  has  recommended  that  designers 
avoid sharing mechanisms that overwh the recipient [18,21]. 
It is common for people to self-censor in these networks [52] 
or post something that they later regretted [53]. 

Sharing Trigger 
Another important dimension to consider is what triggers a 
share. Many applications stream data constantly, viewable in 
a  profile  or  on  a  webpage.  This  streaming  data  may  be 
collected  and  updated  in  the  background  as  long  as  the 
application is enabled (e.g. steps [18], location [46]) or may 
be  limited  to  during  a  specific  activity  (e.g.  while  running 
[15,40],  while  listening  to  music  [20]).  Other  applications 
share  when  a  self-tracker  arrives  at  a  designated  location 
[3,5]  or  arrives  near  another  self-tracker  [34].  In  other 
applications,  shares  are  triggered  automatically  once  a  day 
[11,35,56]. 

All  of  the  above  systems  implement  automatic  sharing  of 
activity, but another class of features enable the self-tracker 
to  trigger  sharing  on  their  own  [14,36,42].  Other  systems 
enable recipients to solicit data from the sharer, giving the 
sharer the choice to respond [11,27]. 

lose 

their  data  and 

In  applications  that  share  automatically,  the  sharer  can 
become  disconnected  from 
the 
opportunity to explain its significance. By requiring the self-
tracker to share manually, they are required to both reflect 
upon the data collected and decide whether the post is worth 
making. However, when sharing is automatic, self-trackers 
may share more and thus receive more benefits from sharing. 
For  example,  automatic  sharing  may  be  particularly 
important  for  creating  accountability.  To  our  knowledge, 
researchers  have  not  systematically  studied  the  tradeoffs

between  encouraging  automatic  posts  and  self-tracker

Persistence 
Applications can also vary how long shared data is available. 
CoupleVibe automatically shared messages about a remote 
partner’s location using short vibrations. If the recipient did 
not notice when it occurred, the old location was lost forever 
[3].  This  approach  is  especially  applicable  for  other  time-
dependent  systems,  where  the  relevant  data  to  share  is 
occurring at the current moment. 

Other  research  applications,  including  Chick  Clique  and 
Fish’N’Steps, implement shares persisting for the life of the 
system [35,56]. Posts of personal informatics data made to a 
social network (versus a research prototype), including from 
[36,42,55], exist for as long as the network is relevant. Both 
groups of systems preserve a record of previous shares for 
browsing or searching. These systems  may  also enable the 
self-tracker to delete a prior share [55]. 

People sometimes post data to social network sites to create 
a private record of events in their lives [58]. This, combined 
with  being  aware  of  and  finding  patterns  in  their  activity 
[8,19],  demonstrates  the  value  of  sharing  to  a  persistent 
social  network  even  when  another  record  does  not  exist. 
Enabling the deletion of shares is important for impression 
management,  and  deletion  is  a  common  strategy  for 
managing regretful posts to social networks [53]. 

Post Content 
Application designers have explored different types of share 
content.  Systems  have  supported  sharing  personally 
collected  data through  numerical  summaries  [11,35],  maps 
[36,46], and graphs [15,18,37]. These have varied in level of 
detail,  ranging  from  a  vague  statement  that  an  activity  has 
been  completed  to  a  detailed  post,  including,  for  example, 
distance, route, time, and location of a run, as well as heart 
rate and mood [38, RunKeeper]. People have also expressed 
an  interest  in having  the  details  hosted outside of  the SAS 
and  posting  only  a  link.  Apart  from  providing  more  detail 
than possible in a SAS post, people rarely use these features 
because they lead to uninteresting posts [38]. 

Some  applications  encourage  users  to  annotate  the  tracked 
data  with  information  about  its  significance,  provide  more 
details,  or  photos  [13,23].  This  content  conveys  more 
context, but also requires user time and effort to generate. 

Prior work has not explored the importance of post content. 
It  is  unclear  when  it  is  necessary  for  the  self-tracker  to 
provide  self-generated  content  versus  system-generated 
content  to  receive  feedback.  Furthermore,  what  self-
generated content posters should add has not been studied; 
we explore this later in this paper, considering both how self-
trackers  currently  curate  their  posts,  as  well  as  how  the 
audience views these posts. 

Collaborative Design ApproachesCSCW 2015, March 14-18, 2015, Vancouver, BC, Canada1625 
Audience 
Sharers  and  system  designers  must  also  decide  who  will 
receive posts. Systems have connected sharers with a variety 
of audiences, including pre-organized teams of random co-
workers at a large corporation [35] to people who are friends 
or otherwise  already  know  each other  [11,27,56]  to  family 
and  significant  others  [3,9].  In  each  of  these  systems  and 
evaluations, all users were also participating in the activity. 
Thus,  they  saw  each  other  as  peers  with  similar  goals  and 
shared experiences [42]. 

Other  systems  and  studies  explored  posting  to  a  broader 
social  network,  such  as  Facebook  [42]  and  Twitter  [55]. 
GoalPost participants could share physical activity goals and 
journals  to  Facebook,  but  many  worried  about  posting 
to  others. 
that  would  seem 
accomplishments 
Participants were also underwhelmed and discouraged when 
their  posts  received  few  responses  [42].  Teodoro  and 
Naaman found people posted to Twitter to feel accountable 
to  their  audience  and  did  not  express  concern  about  their 
audience’s opinion on their posts [55]. 

trivial 

One  way  of  negotiating  post  audience  is  to  use  a  popular 
social network site to distribute the posts, but to restrict its 
distribution to a subset of the network. Prior work has limited 
the audience on these social network sites by building apps 
on the platform [37] or restricting post visibility to a list of 
supportive  friends  identified  by  the  user  [42].  Groups  also 
self-organize  on  these  networks,  such  as  by  creating 
Facebook groups with shared step goals or utilizing the same 
Twitter hashtag. 

Post  audience  in  prior  work  has  varied  from  other  study 
participants (both friends and strangers) to social networks 
(both  specific  to  the  data  being  tracked  and  broad).  The 
norms  of  each  of  these  audiences  vary.  In  self-contained 
studies where the audience is a part of the study, the audience 
can relate with the sharer through their joint experience [44]. 

Despite hopes for using social network sites to share personal 
informatics data [43,55], there remain many challenges and 
best practices are not yet well understood [42]. Some social 
networks  include  features  to  help  both  sharers  and  their 
audience  navigate  sharing  challenges.  For  example, 
Facebook  and  some  Twitter  clients  enable  hiding  posts 
originating  from  a  certain  application  or  with  a  certain 
hashtag. 

Individual  preferences  and  comfort  with  different  sharing 
audiences are heterogeneous. For example, some people are 
comfortable sharing their fine-grained physical activity with 
their entire social network, while others were only willing to 
share with close friends, or no one at all [18]. In the GoalPost 
study,  some  participants  configured  a  “support  group”  of 
Facebook friends who could view their posts. Some included 
no one in their support group – making their posts a private 
record  for  themselves  –  and  others  shared  with  supportive 
friends, partners, or teammates; many other participants just 
chose to share with their entire Facebook network [42]. 

APPLYING THE DESIGN FRAMEWORK DIMENSIONS 
To demonstrate the value of using these sharing dimensions 
as  an  analytical  framework,  we  apply  the  dimensions  to  a 
case  study  of  physical  activity  shares  from  the  RunKeeper 
application  posted  on  Twitter.  RunKeeper  is  a  commercial 
smartphone physical activity tracker with 25 million users, 
with runners logging over 2 million miles per day through 
the application at the time of this publication. 

RunKeeper automatically records distance, time, and route, 
and  enables  posting  to  Twitter  either  automatically  or 
manually  after  each  exercise  session.  The  user  can  add 
personalized  text  or  a  picture  to  each  tweet.  The  app  also 
enables sharing of runs, walks, or bike rides in real time. 

This  analysis  focuses  on  unpacking  the  dimension  of  Post 
Content to answer the question: How does the content of a 
RunKeeper  post  to  Twitter  influence  follower  impressions 
and responses? The results of our analysis are generalized to 
the other sharing dimensions of our design framework in the 
discussion section below. 

(Twitter)  constrain 

The  combination  of  application  (RunKeeper)  and  social

•  Data Domain: physical activity, specifically RunKeeper 
•  Preprocessing:  minimal,  configurable

activity, pace, distance, and cumulative time 

•  Sharing Trigger: posted at the conclusion of an activity, 
either  automatically  or  manually  triggered  by  the  user. 
Live events are shared at the beginning of the activity with 
a link to follow activity progress 

•  Persistent: exist as long as the social network does or until 

the poster deletes it 

•  Audience:  followers  on  Twitter  social  network  and 

anyone following the “#RunKeeper” hashtag 

Focusing  on  the  content  dimension  and  fixing  the  other 
dimensions in this way facilitated a more tractable analysis. 

Framework evaluation methods 
We  conducted  two  evaluations  of  tweets  made  through 
RunKeeper, supported by a formative survey on sharer goals 
and desired reactions. We first learn about the posts people 
make  by  analyzing  recent  tweets  made  via  RunKeeper, 
characterizing the types of posts people make as well as what 
posts  generate  responses  (referred  to  as  the  Collected 
Tweets, or CT study). We then evaluated audience reactions 
to similar tweets by generating a set of tweets representing a 
variety of commonly shared content and then conducting a 
survey  to  elicit  audience  feedback  (referred  to  as  the 
Generated Tweets, or GT study). 

Formative survey: sharer goals and desired reactions 
To  identify  desirable  reactions  to  sharing,  we  conducted  a 
formative  survey  about  self-tracker’s  experiences  sharing 
physical  activity  on  a  social  network.  32  respondents 
recruited  from  University  mailing  lists  and  self-tracking 
forums (26 female, 6 male; average age 35.3, median 31, min 

Collaborative Design ApproachesCSCW 2015, March 14-18, 2015, Vancouver, BC, Canada1626 
21,  max  63)  described  their  best  and  worst  sharing 
experiences. Likes, comments, and in-person conversations 
were  mentioned  important  characteristics  of  their  best 
experiences sharing personal informatics data by 14, 14, and 
2  respondents,  respectively.  Twelve  respondents  described 
their  worst  experience  sharing  their  physical  activity;  the 
remainder  either  stated  that  they  had  not  had  a  negative 
experience  or  left  the  question  blank.  Eight  respondents 
mentioned receiving no feedback (e.g. likes or comments) as 
part of what made the experience their worst. 

From  this  survey,  we  learn  that  self-trackers  positively 
correlate comments or likes to how positive of an experience 
they  had  making  the post.  R39  mentions  how  feedback on 
their  physical  activity  made 
them  feel:  “likes  and 
encouraging comments make me feel good about what I did.” 
R19  strongly  stated  his  feelings  when  his  posts  did  not 
receive feedback: “If a tweet falls in a timeline and nobody's 
there to hear it... No feedback is the worst feedback!” These 
results,  and  their  consistency  with  prior  work  [42,43], 
encouraged us to use SAS feedback mechanisms (e.g., likes 
or  favorites,  comments  or  replies)  as  measures  for  how 
positively a sharer evaluates the success of their posts. 

Collected Tweets (CT) study 
We  began  our  CT  study  analysis  by  randomly  sampling 
5,000 tweets from all public tweets posted with the hashtag 
“#RunKeeper” between late-December 2013 and mid-April 
2014.  Approximately  652,000  public  tweets  were  posted 
with  this  hashtag  during  this  span,  so  our  initial  sample 
represents 0.77% of all tweets posted in this span with the 
hashtag “#RunKeeper”. 

We coded each tweet for 10 features, described in Table 2. 
These features were selected to characterize the variability in 
the post content, highlighting common trends when posting 
to Twitter from RunKeeper. We additionally coded for the 
number of replies, favorites, and retweets.  

Two researchers coded each tweet. When the assigned codes 
differed, a third researcher coded the tweet and the dispute 
was resolved by majority vote. 4,256 of the 5,000 tweets had 
agreement  across  all  codes  after  two  coders.  19  of  the 
remaining  744  tweets  still  had  disagreement  after  three 
coders (each of these disagreements occurred as a result of 
the  dimension  having  more  than  two  levels),  and  were 
resolved through group discussion by five coders. 

Eight  people  coded  unequal  portions  of  the  tweets.  To 
measure the agreement among the coders, each person coded 
a  set  of  100  tweets  presented  in  a  random  order.  We  used 
Fleiss’ Kappa to assess inter-coder reliability among our 10 
subjective, nominal codes. We received high agreement for 
“live  event”,  “not  an  activity  share”,  “activity  type”, 
“broken”,  and  “zero  minutes  ran”  (1.00,  1.00,  0.97,  0.96, 
0.87) and moderate agreement for “post type”, “non-English 
tweet content”, “negative emotion”, and “positive emotion” 
(0.79,  0.76,  0.64,  0.56).  Mentions  of  another  user  did  not 
occur in the set sampled for inter-coder reliability.

Yes or No 

We excluded a portion of these tweets from analysis. Tweets 
were  captured  in  real-time,  so  if  the  tweeter  changed  their 
profile settings to make their tweets private or deleted their 
account or the specific tweets, the tweet became no longer 
publically accessible. We removed 189 tweets not publically 
accessible as of mid-May 2014. We additionally removed 13 
tweets where the tweeter had no followers, as these tweets 
were unlikely to receive responses. Finally, we removed 27 
tweets  not  posted  by  the  RunKeeper  application  (such  as 
recommendations to friends to install RunKeeper or links to 
news articles mentioning RunKeeper). These tweets differed 
content and goals from posts made using the RunKeeper app. 

Removing all tweets with these characteristics reduced our 
sample to 4,771 tweets, and our remaining analysis considers 
only these tweets. 

Statistical methods in the CT study 
We used regression analyses to characterize the correlations 
between different tweet attributes and responses. We used a 
Poisson model for the number favorites and retweets because 
each  favorite  or  retweet  came  from  one  unique  user.  For 
replies, however, we used a negative binomial model for if a 
tweet received replies or not:  many tweets received a high 
number of replies but involved only a small number of users 
or  quickly  went  off  topic,  and  so  additional  replies  rarely 
offered further support. In all models, we used log(followers) 
as  an  offset  (exposure)  variable,  because  one’s  follower 
count limited their potential for replies. 

To differentiate between excess zeros caused by attributes of 
the user’s account and zeros caused by attributes of the tweet, 
we used zero inflated model in all three analyses, due to the 
fact that 4,362 of the 4,771 tweets (91.4%) did not receive 
any response from Twitter users. We used the presence of the 
default  image  and  the  log  of  the  user’s  tweet  frequency  to 
predict the excess zeros. 

For  the regression  analysis, we  removed  an  additional  432 
tweets  containing  non-English  text  because  we  were  not 
confident in our ability to code emotion in these tweets. A 
robustness check – including these tweets and repeating our 
analysis – does not alter the results. 

Descriptive findings of the CT study 
From  our  analysis  of  these  tweets,  a  few  common  trends 
emerged. Most (74.0%) of the tweets included only system-

Figure 1. Tweets generated for the GT study varied on several dimensions, allowing us to separately evaluate the role 
of each of these features. 

generated content. Of the tweets that included user-generated 
text, 22.0% contained positive or negative emotion. We also 
observed  tweets  containing  descriptions  of  the  weather, 
asking for advice or support, and additional information such 
as heart rate or run intervals. 299 runners added pictures in 
their  tweets,  which  were  typically  landscapes,  pictures  of 
their shoes, or selfies. 

Prior work has studied the sharer perspective for generating 
such posts [11,38,42,56]. Because sharers in prior work and 
in our survey of goals and desired responses emphasize the 
importance of audience responses for feeling that they have 
achieved their posting goals, we focus on audience reactions 
and  opinions.  We  analyzed  these  tweets  for  audience 
response, including replies, favorites, and retweets. 

Analysis  of  tweets  in  this  study,  however,  only  takes  into 
account  the  observable  responses.  It  cannot  measure 
unobservable  actions  or  audience  members’  opinions  and 
reactions that did not result in a favorite, reply, or retweet. 
That  is,  from  the  CT  study  we  can  learn  what  tweets  get 
replies, favorites, or retweets by not why or any other ways 
in which people may have reacted. 

Generated Tweets (GT) study 
With the limitations of the CT study in mind, we conducted 
a second study to better understand how a post about physical 
activity  to  a  SAS  would  be  interpreted  by  potential 
consumers or readers. We used the descriptive findings from 
the CT study to generate parameters for a system to randomly 
generate tweets similar to those we coded in the CT study. 
Three tweets generated by our system appear in Figure 1. 

We varied nine parameters when generating tweets. Tweets 
could contain a milestone event (half marathon, return from 
surgery, or a long-term goal), one of four types of requests to 
the  audience  (asking  for  a  recommendation,  support, 
accountability,  or  an  activity  partner),  or  details  about  the 
sharer’s  run.  The  details  about  the  run  included  positive 
emotion (e.g., “felt good”, “best run in a while”), negative 
emotion 
(e.g.,  “that  sucked”,  “knee  hurt”),  and/or 
information  about  the  weather  (e.g.,  “weather  is  great”,  “a 
little chilly”). The distance of the run was random between 2 
and 15 miles, and could be either live or have already taken 
place.  Finally,  the  post  could  include  a  photo  of  either  a 
runner’s  shoes  or  a  landscape  depicting  the  run’s  location. 

For  the  posts  that  did  not  include  a  photo,  RunKeeper’s 
default Twitter card was displayed with statistics about pace 
(an  8:30  per  mile  pace  regardless  of  distance)  and  calorie 
consumption  (calculated  using  the  American  College  of 
Sports Medicine metabolic consumption rate formula [1] for 
a person weighing 150 pounds). 

Some  parameters  affected  what  we  displayed  for  other 
parameters.  For  example,  if  the  tweet  communicated  poor 
weather and a picture was to be shown, the picture changed 
to a rainy park or wet shoes. We additionally removed certain 
combinations of parameters that did not make sense, such as 
displaying  distance  or  calorie  information  for  a  tweet 
announcing  the  beginning  of  a  live  run.  To  ensure  short, 
realistic-sounding  tweets,  specific  information  was  not 
combined with life event information or audience requests; 
otherwise generated tweets could exceed 140 characters. We 
sought  to preserve grammar,  with  tenses  corrected for  live 
tweets  (e.g.,  “great  run”  for  a  previously-occurring  tweet 
versus “excited to run” for a live tweet) and appropriate use 
of conjunctions (e.g., “that sucked, but happy I did it” for a 
tweet containing a positive and negative emotion). 

recruited 

Varying  all  of  these  parameters  resulted  in  102  possible 
styles of tweets, plus additional variation in exact wording, 
content ordering, and run distance. We used a factorial study 
design  to  obtain  responses  to  these  tweets,  surveying  97 
respondents 
from  Twitter,  Facebook,  and 
University  mailing  lists;  respondents  were  entered  into  a 
raffle  for  one  $50  or  two  $25  Amazon  gift  cards.  Each 
respondent  saw  five  tweets.  Each  tweet  contained  a 
randomly-ordered  gender-neutral  name 
(Alex,  Jamie, 
Cameron,  Kendall,  and  Taylor),  a  randomly  composed 
Twitter  username  (supplementing  the  name  with  letters  or 
numbers), and a random profile picture (a landscape). These 
three parameters had no statistically significant effects on our 
responses, and we exclude them from further analysis. 

The  five  tweets  that  each  respondent  saw  were  selected  to 
overlap on four or fewer parameters to avoid the feeling that 
respondents  were  seeing  the  same  tweets  multiple  times. 
Finally, our survey enforced that no two tweets among the 
five generated for an individual contained the same picture. 
As a result, tweets containing RunKeeper Twitter cards were 
oversampled in our analysis.

Table 3. Results from regression models on a) whether a Tweet received replies, b) the number of favorites received, 
and c) the number of retweets received. 

For each tweet, we asked respondents to select from a list of 
reasons  why  they  believed  the  poster  shared.  This  list  was 
motivated by prior work [44,55]. Reasons included to receive 
emotional support, to be held more accountable, and to boast 
or show off. Respondents were asked to describe their initial 
reaction  to  the  tweet  in  a  freeform  text  box.  They  were 
additionally  asked  to  indicate  on  four  5-item  Likert-scales 
whether they agreed with being happy or annoyed that their 
friend  made  the  post  and  whether  they  found  the  post 
interesting or boring. Finally, they were asked whether they 
would reply to the post, and to describe how they would reply 
or why they would not reply using an open-ended text box. 

97 people responded to at least one tweet in the survey; 83 
responded to all five they were presented (mean: 4.58, stdev: 
1.06), resulting in 444 total responses to the tweets. Sixty-
two respondents identified as female, thirty-four male, and 
one did not provide a response. Respondent average age was 
28.49 (stdev: 7.79, median: 26, min: 18, max: 63). 45 stated 
they  ran  regularly,  and  14  of  these  respondents  regularly 
posted their runs to social media. 18 respondents had used 
RunKeeper to track their runs before, and 56 used Twitter. 

Seven  researchers  used  affinity  diagramming  to  categorize 
respondent  reactions  and  reply  descriptions  into  similar 
themes. Two researchers further refined these initial groups, 
and the qualitative results from this refinement are presented 
in the results section.

Statistical methods in the GT study 
We  used  similar  regression  analyses  to  the  CT  study  to 
characterize 
tweet 
attributes and audience reactions. We used Ordinal Logistic 
Regression on responses to the 5-item Likert questions about 
whether respondents found the tweet interesting or boring, or 
whether they would be happy or annoyed if a friend made the 
tweet.  We  perform  multilevel  modeling  by  respondent  to 
control for intrinsic respondent opinions. 

Limitations 
Even with two studies, there remain some limitations in our 
analysis.  Because  we  only  analyzed  tweets  that  were 
publically  available  in  mid-May  2014  in  the  CT  study, we 
did not analyze any that a sharer removed after receiving no 
response or a negative response, an impression management 
strategy identified in prior work [53]. We additionally did not 
collect any replies, favorites, or retweets occurring after that 
point, though we anticipate that there were very few, as all 
tweets  had  been  shared  for  at  least  30  days  before  we 
collected the reply data. Since followers can change at any 
time, the audience count we use may differ somewhat from 
their count at the time they shared. We also noticed some of 
the tweeters had been followed, favorited, and/or retweeted 
by bots, and these are included in our analysis even though 
they  may  not  result  in  the  same  feelings  of  support  as 
reactions from real people. 

The  tweets  in  the  GT  study  were  all  hypothetical,  so 
respondents’  actual  behavior  may  differ  from  what  they 
described  in  the  survey  and  respondents  may  or  may  not 
actually respond to the tweets posed if they were presented 
in  context.  Given  the  frank  nature  of  the  responses,  we 
believe respondent reactions to tweets seen in the study were 
authentic.  As  discussed  later,  many  respondents  indicated 
their  response  would  depend  on  their  relationship  with  the 
tweeter.  Neither  our  study  of  actual  tweets  nor  our  survey 
measured the influence of these factors. 

RESULTS 
We triangulate the results from CT and GT studies to create 
a  more  complete  understanding  of  how  people  post  and 
respond to posts from RunKeeper to Twitter. Results from 
the regressions analyses of the CT and GT study data appear 
in tables 3 and 4, respectively. 

System-generated content 
Analysis of tweets from our CT study shows that tweets with 
user-generated text receive more replies (Z = 4.63, p < 0.001, 
95% CI: 1.94-5.12 more replies) and how many favorites a

characteristics impacted respondent opinions.

tweet receives (Z = 5.25, p < 0.001, 95% CI: 0.51-1.11 more

text  receive  fewer  retweets  (Z  =  -2.61,  p  <  0.01,  95%  CI: 
0.51-3.60  fewer  retweets)  than  those  that  do  not.  This 
suggests that adding content to a tweet, even when combined 
with system-generated content from an application, is more 
likely to generate responses. 

The  factorial  design  in  the  GT  study  resulted  in  only  13 
respondents  viewing  a  tweet  containing  only  system-
generated  content.  Three  of  these  respondents  said  such 
tweets felt automatic: “there’s no comment attached to this - 
just an automatic posting” (GT80). GT49 reacted negatively 
to the tweet as a result, saying, “this looks more canned, like 
maybe the app shot it off without Cameron knowing about 
it… very impersonal.” 

Even when a tweet contained user-generated content, some 
GT  study  respondents  reacted  negatively  to  the  system-
generated content. GT2 saw a tweet containing a request for 
a running buddy, and reacted, “I wouldn't take the ‘run with 
me  next  time’  thing  seriously.  It  feels  impersonal  mostly 
because it's not some kind of direct message to me, but also 
because it's part of a canned tweet. Even if they really mean 
it, I don’t believe they do.”  

We conducted a secondary analysis on the 27 tweets in the 
CT study made with the RunKeeper hashtag not containing 
any system-generated text, which were previously excluded. 
These  tweets were  more  likely  to  receive responses (χ2 (1, 
N  =  4798)  =  28.14,  p  <  0.001),  favorites  (χ2  (1, 
N  =  4798)  =  15.63,  p  <  0.001),  and  retweets  (χ2  (1, 
N  = 4798)  = 65.75,  p  <  0.001)  than  tweets  posted  through 
RunKeeper.  However,  this  is  dependent  on  a  small 
proportion of tweets without any system-generated text. 

Details about activity are well-received 
Many  tweeters  in  the  CT  study  included  additional  details 
about  the  weather  in  their  tweets,  such  as  CT4756:  “Just 
completed a 10.26 mi run - A cold wind and lovely sunshine” 
and CT2912: “Just completed a 7.49 km run - 6°C, WC: 2°C, 
20km/h WSW, 81%”. Others supplemented their posts with 
additional  statistics  about  their  run,  such  as  biometrics  or 
how they were training in CT1843: “Just completed a 2.24 
mi run - 6x400, pace 09:34 /mile, max HR 169”. 

Figure 2. Respondents  agreed  that both posts  lacking 
pictures  and  posts  with  pictures  of  shoes  were  more 
boring than pictures of landscapes. 
RunKeeper includes distance as part of the system-generated 
content in the tweets. Twitter users occasionally responded 
to  this  distance,  such  as  in  CT2250,  which  received  the 
response “only 2.71? ... And you were giving me grief for 4 
;p”. Twelve GT study respondents explicitly reacted to the 
distance  of  a  run.  Most  were  impressed  by  the  tweeter, 
including  GT67:  “Holy  shit  he  ran  9  miles?”  Other 
respondents  acknowledged  the  significance  of  the  event  in 
their response, such as GT23 who wrote “4 miles for a first 
run sounds impressive.”  

The content of the tweet influenced GT study respondents’ 
opinions of the tweet. When a post included a specific reason 
for  the  run,  respondents  found  the  post  less  annoying 
(F1,363  =  15.84,  p  <  0.001),  less  boring  (F1,365  =  10.35, 
p < 0.01), and more interesting (F1,366 = 6.47, p < 0.05), and 
were happier to see it (F1,365 = 15.09, p < 0.001). Consistent 
with  suggestions  from  prior  work  [42,44],  when  a  post 
contains  a  request  of  the  audience,  respondents  found  the 
post  less  annoying  (F1,362  =  5.57,  p  <  0.05),  less  boring 
(F1,364 = 7.05, p < 0.01), and more interesting (F1,365 = 4.67, 
p < 0.05). 

Pictures in posts are seen as valuable 
In  the  CT  study,  we  did  not  find  a  significant  effect  of 
pictures on whether a tweet receives replies (Z = −1.31, n.s.) 
or how many favorites (Z = −0.82, n.s.) or retweets (Z = -
0.08,  n.s.)  a  post  receives.  The  GT  study  identified  a 
significant  effect  of  picture  on  whether  a  post  was  boring 
(F2,355  =  8.50,  p  <  0.001)  and  interesting  (F2,356  =  4.58, 
p  <  0.05),  displayed  in  Figure  2.  While  a  picture  may  not 
trigger more feedback, the tweet audience still values posts 
with photos more. 

The content of the picture also affected audience responses. 
We  used  a  Wilcoxon  signed  rank  test  to  compare  the 
impressions of the 54 audience respondents who saw both a 
landscape  and  a  shoe  picture.  Shoe  pictures  were  more 
boring (Z = 2.36, p < 0.01, 95% CI: 0.25-4 on a 5-item Likert 
scale)  than  pictures  of  landscapes.  However,  there  was  no 
difference  in  how  interesting  participants  found  these  two 
types of pictures  (Z  = -0.49, n.s.).  Both  received primarily 
positive  reactions  from  the  audience,  with  respondents 
reacting  to  the  “nice  shoes”  (GT50;  sentiment  shared  by 
GT57, 64, 76),  “liking  the  setting  that  is pictured”  (GT14; 
shared  by  GT5,  41,  50,  56,  57,  64,  65,  74,  88),  and  even 

Collaborative Design ApproachesCSCW 2015, March 14-18, 2015, Vancouver, BC, Canada1630 
 
“Makes  me  want  to  go  walk  the  same  location”  (GT55). 
Others  wondered,  “Why  are  you  showing  me  a  picture  of 
your shoes?” (GT93). 

Live events do not receive feedback 
Live  tweets  were  not  more  likely  to  receive  responses 
(Z  =  −0.02,  n.s.)  or  influence  the  number  of  favorites 
(Z=−0.20, n.s.) or retweets (Z = 0.33, n.s.); none of the 123 
live tweets in the CT set received replies. Eight of the ninety-
four GT study respondents who saw a live tweet stated they 
would follow the link to watch their friend run live. Seven 
others did not see value in watching someone else run, such 
as GT96: “I have better things to do than watch someone's 
run online”. 

Positive outcomes from sharing 
Both the CT and GT study found positive experiences that 
could  result  from  sharing,  for  both  the  tweeter  and  the 
audience. 

Positive impressions of the tweeter 
GT study respondents were “happy for” the tweeter (GT8, 9, 
10,  14,  32,  79).  GT66  elaborated  more  on  this  sentiment, 
being  “glad  that  my  friend  is  making  a  commitment  to  be 
active.” Providing context for a run tended to support these 
feelings:  “Good  to  see  them  back  on  their  feet”  (GT62,  a 
sentiment  shared  by  GT24,  45)  and  “Oh  good,  they're 
running  a  half  marathon.  I  hope  they  do  well.”  (GT74,  a 
sentiment shared by GT80, who stated “I am grinning just 
looking at this”). While these respondents may not reply or 
interact  with  the  tweeter  within  the  social  network,  these 
positive  impressions  indicate  a  potential  for  in-person 
conversations  about  running  that  might  not  have  occurred 
without the share. We do not evaluate impressions generated 
from the CT set, as this would not be feasible. 

Favoriting 
Favoriting  a  tweet  requires  little  effort  from  followers  but 
provides  an  easy  way  to  provide  emotional  support  or 
motivate the poster without taking as much effort as a reply. 
Six  GT  study  respondents  said  that  they  would  favorite  a 
tweet, with GT18 noting the lower threshold: “just a favorite. 
I don't reply to anything often.” 

User-generated text in a tweet seemed to give followers more 
to respond  to. This  could  be a  positive  sentiment:  CT4204 
received  four  favorites  for  stating  a  run  was  “Easy  Peasy 
Lemon  Squeezy”,  a  negative  sentiment:  one  favorite  for 
adding “#dying #turtlesrunfaster” (CT4678), or simply what 
the  runner  was  thinking:  one  favorite  for  “Push  it  to  the 
limits” (CT508).  

Replying 
Twenty-seven  GT  study  respondents  indicated  they  would 
reply to at least one of the tweets that they saw. These replies 
fell into three general categories. Congratulating the runner 
was a common type of support with “good job!” (GT1, 8, 10, 
31,  42,  67,  85,  97;  replies  to  CT1221,  1661,  2311,  3570, 
4419),  “congrats!”  (GT15,  81,  replies  to  CT2160,  3755), 
“great  work!”  (replies  to  CT563,  1607,  4170,  4454,  4533, 

Figure  3.  Respondents  indicated  that  they  were  more 
likely to respond to posts that included information about 
a  run,  a  request  for  a  running  partner,  a  request  for 
support, or if they were a runner or a Twitter user. 
4832) or simply “yay!” (GT11, reply to CT4382) or “wow!” 
(replies to CT1128, T4423, T4907). Others encouraged the 
runner, with “come on!” (GT1, 10), “you can do it!” (reply 
to  CT1121)  or  “keep  at  it!”  (GT8,  85).  Finally,  GT  study 
respondents  responded  expressing  care  for  the  runner:  “be 
careful” (GT1, 59 in response to runners who were injured 
or recovering for injury). 

Forty-three  tweets  in  our  CT  set  received  more  than  two 
replies.  These  posts  show  conversations  occurring  over 
Twitter  as  a  result  of  the  post.  These  conversations  were 
often follow-ups about how the runner was feeling, such as  
“How’s the hammy?” (reply to CT1779) and “How are you 
feeling  now?”  (reply  to  CT4170).  GT  study  respondents 
similarly  replied  with  questions  for  the  tweeter,  such  as 
“Where are you running?” (GT85). These questions serve as 
an effective way to engage the runner and can provide useful 
advice for other followers. 

 GT study respondents said they would offer or solicit advice 
in response to several hypothetical tweets. GT8, 35, and 71 
offered  recommendations  on  routes,  with  GT35  saying,  “I 
might think of my favorite running routes and suggest one to 
them”,  and  GT7  indicated  they  might  reply  “if  I  wanted 
advice  on  getting  a  better  time”.  The  original  tweeter  of 
CT4423 offered advice to one of their followers who stopped 
running: “joining the running club & #parkrun have got me 
back into it, I’m loving it!” 

Figure 3 presents how characteristics of the tweet and of the 
respondent  vary  GT  study  respondents’  likelihood  of 
responding.  Runners  are  slightly  more  likely  to  respond  to 
tweets than non-runners (χ2  (1, N = 444)=2.34, p < 0.1), but 
Twitter  users  were  no  more  likely  to  respond  than  non-
Twitter  users  (χ2    (1,  N  =  444)=0.15,  n.s.).  Sharing  the 
interest  or  experience  increases  a  follower’s  likelihood  of 
reply, and responses may increase with an audience who can 
better relate to the post content. 

Responding beyond Twitter 
Nine GT study respondents indicated that they would want 
to run with the tweeter in the future, some in direct response 
to  a  request  for  a  running  buddy  “Let  me  join  next  time?” 
(GT45, similar replies by GT1, 35, 47, 77), or following up 
from an injury recovery “Oh cool, he’s back from surgery, 

Collaborative Design ApproachesCSCW 2015, March 14-18, 2015, Vancouver, BC, Canada1631 
let’s  go  on  a  run  together”  (GT24).  CT3969  received  a 
response asking to run together: “nice run, up for 15 [miles] 
this Sunday?” 

wondered  why  this  content  appeared  on  Twitter:  “I  scoff 
because  why  do  they  need  to  tweet  this.”  GT74  and  GT93 
wondered, “why would I want to watch you run?” 

Finally, posts sometimes motivated their audience to go run 
themselves, such as GT88, “I wanna go for a run”. Others 
posted concerns about their own running habits. A reply to 
CT763  expressed  concerns  about  starting  to  run:  “wish  I 
could get myself motivated and off my ass to start running 
mate. Can’t get started.” The original tweeter then offered 
encouragement back to the replier. 

Connecting with the tweeter 
When tweets made an audience member think of their own 
experiences, the audience member felt more connected with 
the  tweeter  and  was  more  inclined  to  respond.  GT80 
reminisced about her own running experiences: “I remember 
when I was in that place, posting short runs with pictures and 
training for my first half!”, and indicated she would want to 
reply  with  saying  “I  empathize  with  this  situation  and  I'd 
want to encourage this person to keep working toward their 
goal.” 

Other  GT  study  respondents  discussed  relating  to  or 
commiserating with the tweeter. GT19 commented “Seeing 
as  I  have  knee  pain  from  time  to  time,  I'd  be  pretty 
sympathetic to this individual.” GT92 similarly related to the 
runner, commenting, “I would commiserate, as I also rarely 
look forward to runs.” 

The  CT  set  also  contained  several  examples  of  shared 
experiences  between  tweeters  and  an  audience  member. 
People encouraged their teammates and people who they ran 
with, such as CT4705 “motor on teammate!!!” and CT469 
“great,  we  have  to  keep  the  momentum.”  Some  tweeters 
added text to indicate who they were with, e.g., “With Dave 
& Matty” (CT123) and “Walking with Vinny” (CT3922) or 
@mentioning  the  others,  including:  “Thanks  @[removed] 
for getting me out of bed!!” (CT4074). 

Undesired consequences to sharing 
A large portion of GT study respondents reacted negatively 
to  some  or  all  of  the  tweets  they  saw.  In  this  section,  we 
describe  negative  repercussions  of  sharing  and  how  some 
audience members react to seeing these posts. 

Our  CT  study  analysis  is  unable  to  capture  many  of  the 
potential  negative  reactions:  we  were  unable  to  observe 
reactions such as unfollowing a person, hiding posts from the 
RunKeeper app, feeling bored, or forming a more negative 
impression about the sharer. Thus, to characterize potential 
negative reactions, we use data from the GT study. 

Tweets are ignored by the audience 
Thirteen  out  of  the  ninety-seven  GT  study  respondents 
indicated they would ignore at least one the tweets, with eight 
others reacting to a tweet with “meh.” Seventy-three of the 
respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the statement “I 
found  this  post  boring”  for  at  least  one  tweet,  suggesting 
survey  respondents  did  not  care  for  this  content.  GT52 

Fifty-five  respondents  agreed  or  strongly  agreed  with  the 
statement “I would be annoyed if a friend shared this” to at 
least  one  tweet.  In  the  free  response  section,  sixteen 
respondents described being annoyed by at least one tweet, 
with  eleven  reacting  “ugh”. GT16  reacted “annoyed, don’t 
care” and “I don’t want to encourage posts like this.” GT70 
commented, “Really, bro, no one cares.” Four respondents 
said they would unfollow the poster or try to hide the post. 

This sentiment did not come through in our CT study, likely 
because  Twitter  followers  did  not  want  to  post  negative 
replies publically. GT62 stated, “I dislike this post and would 
want  to  keep  that  negativity  off  their  account.”  GT2  felt 
similarly: “I wouldn't reply because if I did it'd be something 
really rude so it's better to just keep it to myself. Or maybe 
it's better to unfollow the person.” 

An audience member ignoring or being annoyed by a tweet 
often  has  the  same  outcome  to  the  tweeter:  they  do  not 
respond.  Given  that  people  generally  correlate  responses 
with positive sharing experiences, a large audience ignoring 
these tweets is counter to people’s goals for posting. A lack 
of  response  also  makes  it  difficult  for  the  tweeter  to  learn 
how to regulate their posting habits. Learning that followers 
are annoyed by certain posts may lead to changes in tweeting 
behavior, but this sentiment is rarely publically expressed. 

In  our  CT  study  analysis,  we  observed  that  some  tweeters 
created  separate  accounts  for  posting  only  their  physical 
activity.  This  can  complicates  the  process  of  following 
people on Twitter – how do you learn a Twitter user has a 
separate physical  activity  feed  – but  it  also  gives  audience 
members more control because they can choose whether to 
follow such accounts and receive physical activity tweets. 

Negative impressions of the tweeter 
Some  GT  study  respondents  also  expressed  negative 
opinions  of  the  tweeter  because  of  the  tweet.  Some 
respondents  believed  that  the  tweeter  was  posting  to  brag 
about  their  success.  GT48  reacted,  “someone  likely  wants 
attention,” with GT49 stating, “it looks like he’s just showing 
off.” GT35 and GT74 thought that the tweeter was “fishing 
for compliments”. 

DISCUSSION 
In our analysis of the CT and GT studies, we identified both 
successes in sharing and problems with many shares. In this 
section, we describe some potential causes for the disparity, 
offer  design  recommendations,  and  relate  our  findings  to 
social sharing in personal informatics more broadly. 

System vs. Sharer-generated content 
GT  study  respondents  reacted  negatively  to  tweets  they 
believed RunKeeper had automatically generated. GT66 was 
“annoyed that they didn’t customize their automatic tweets”, 
with GT22 and GT44 suggesting that the tweet “looks like an 

Collaborative Design ApproachesCSCW 2015, March 14-18, 2015, Vancouver, BC, Canada1632 
advertisement”.  Respondents also  appeared to fatigue  after 
seeing multiple tweets, reporting later tweets seen as more 
boring  and  less  interesting.  We  believe  respondents  got 
bored  seeing  the  same  or  similar  content  repeatedly,  a 
byproduct  of  the  prevalence  of  automatically  generated 
content. 

GT  study  respondents  desired  more  information  about  the 
importance of the run when deciding whether to reply, and 
often  responded  positively  when  this  information  was 
provided. GT45 decided to root for a runner “because it’s her 
first run back from surgery.” GT46 contemplated replying, 
stating  “If  they  were  working  towards  a  goal,  I’d  be  more 
likely  to  reply.”  GT92  reports  both  extremes  in  their 
response: “I don’t give a shit about watching people’s live 
runs unless they’re in an important race or they’re doing an 
event in which they need support.” 

We note that posts were better received in the GT study when 
they  contained  a  request  of  the  audience  or  the  context  of 
why  a  run  was  significant.  While  not  every  run  can  be  a 
personal best or major milestone, we believe that describing 
the importance of a run will lead to more positive responses 
and support. 

these 

Design  recommendation:  Together, 
findings 
demonstrate the importance of supplementing the details of 
a  run  with  sharer-generated  content  or  possibly  carefully 
crafted automatically-generated context (such as reporting a 
personal  best).  A  system  can  encourage  this  by  prompting 
the  runner  to  take  a  picture  or  answer  a  question  prior  to 
sharing,  and  including  this  content  in  the  post.  Facebook 
recently took steps toward this. They noticed that people are 
more likely to engage with posts shared explicitly rather than 
automatically  from  within  apps,  and  encourage  application 
developers to share more personal content [57]. 

GT study respondents wanted to know the context of a run to 
determine  whether  to  reply.  GT43  reacted,  “It  needs  more 
context.  Was  this  related  to  an  event?  Or  was  it  a  major 
training run? There is nothing really personal about it. It's 
just a robot post.” A sharing application could easily prompt 
the user with, “why did you run today?” as part of the sharing 
process. 

Audience and post frequency 
Twitter is broad social network where followers range from 
close friends to total strangers. We expect that it is difficult 
to  frame  a  post  about  physical  activity  to  match  the 
expectations of everyone in this audience. 

In  the  GT  study,  thirty-three  respondents  said  that  their 
willingness to reply depended on how well they knew them. 
This ranged  from  “If  I  know  the  person or  not” (GT14)  to 
“Only  if  it’s  a  close  friend”  (GT23).  On  a  whole,  our 
audience seemed more willing to respond to posts made by 
close friends or family members. 

Five  GT  study  respondents  emphasized  the  importance  of 
“how  often  they  post  content  like  this”  (GT62,  sentiment 

shared by GT10). After seeing multiple posts, GT97 notes, 
“the  sense  of  novelty  is  wearing  off,”  and  was  left  less 
enthusiastic  about  posting  support.  Audience  fatigue  may 
play  a  role,  especially  if  this  genre  of  posts  appears 
frequently  in  a  Twitter feed. A highly  motivated  audience, 
such  as  one  of  close  friend  or  one  that  can  relate  to  the 
poster’s challenges, might suffer from less poster fatigue. 

Design  recommendation:  Despite  –  or  because  of  –  the 
ability to reach a wide audience, Twitter may not be the best 
venue  for  regularly  sharing  everyday  physical  activity  or 
other  personal  informatics  information.  One  potentially 
improved system would enable sharing physical activity with 
a  smaller  audience  of  close  friends  or  family  members 
through  lists  within  a  broader  social  network,  though 
previous  work  has  found  that  many  users  do  not  want  to 
spend  the  effort  to  configure  such  lists  [42].  Another 
approach  would  be  to  share  only  to  people  interested  in 
running, either through a dedicated social network, lists of a 
subset of friends or followers, or dedicated accounts. 

The  responses  to  our  GT  study  indicate  that  people  are 
willing to offer support to a close friend even if they are not 
self-trackers 
to  close, 
themselves.  Routing  messages 
supportive  friends  and  to  people  who  have  an  interest  in 
running or self-tracking may result in a better experience for 
sharers and their SAS audiences. 

Twitter  may  still  be  an  appropriate  venue  for  sharing 
significant  achievements,  such  as  returning  from  injury  or 
running  a  race.  An  application  could  recommend  sharing 
these activities to Twitter while dissuading others, changing 
the interaction from automatically generating tweets to one 
that recommends tweeting if the content supports this. 

Mismatch between sharer goal and audience interpretation 
Sharers  have  a  variety  of  goals  for  posting  their  personal 
informatics data to a social networking site, but these reasons 
are not always apparent to the post audience. Followers are 
often  left  wondering  “why  would  someone  post  this?” 
(GT57)  or believing  that  there  is  “nothing  to  say”  in reply 
(GT72, sentiment expressed by GT32, 65) and thus elect not 
to provide any feedback. 

GT90 alludes to another problem: even when a poster does 
not desire specific replies to meet their goal, their post may 
have harmful side effects, such as causing them to be seen as 
a braggart, especially when the post is not clear about why 
about the sharer’s goals. 

I think it's great when people share this kind of stuff because it 
helps  hold  them  accountable  (accountability  is  the  positive 
byproduct).  However,  most  people  are  probably  posting  this 
because they want to brag about their physical activity and the 
sweet views they get while running, but that's not a bad thing 
either if it motivates other people to hit the streets, too. 

For each tweet, respondents were asked to speculate why the 
tweet was posted from a list of reasons. Respondents marked 
55.0% of tweets as posted “to receive emotional support” and 
50.9% as posted “to boast/show off”, (25.3% were perceived 

Collaborative Design ApproachesCSCW 2015, March 14-18, 2015, Vancouver, BC, Canada1633 
as  motivated  by  both  goals).  This  shows  two  different 
audience interpretations, which have conflicting sentiments 
about  the  tweeter.  Bragging  might  be  accepted  and  even 
encouraged  in  peer  support  communities,  which  GT21 
implies:  “I  kind  of 
ignore  [posts]  unless  on 
[MyFitnessPal] because it is FOR bragging about exercise 
;)”, but less well-received on general-purpose SAS.  

just 

Design recommendation: Personal informatics applications 
should  encourage  sharers  to  be  more  explicit  about  what 
feedback  they  are  looking  for  when  they  decide  to  share. 
Prior to sharing, sharers could be asked to answer “why are 
you making this post?” Posting this answer along with the 
original post could give the post audience enough context to 
provide meaningful feedback for the sharer. 

While  we  focus  our  analysis  on  audience  reactions  in  the 
form of replies, favorites, and retweets, some goals may not 
be  better  achieved  through  more  replies.  For  example, 
someone  seeking  advice  may  need  just  one  or  two 
informative  replies,  rather  than  a  variety  of  less  accurate 
replies. Furthermore, for some goals, no specific reply may 
be necessary. Posts made to foster an impression of oneself 
as  an  active,  athletic  individual  might  not  need  replies  to 
achieve  their  goal.  People  also  post  physical  activity  and 
other  goals  to  social  networks  to  feel  more  accountable  to 
those goals. If posting alone is sufficient for people to feel 
more committed to their goal, they may not require feedback 
from their audience. 

Extending beyond RunKeeper and Twitter 
We  believe  that  many  of  the  design  recommendations  we 
developed for sharing RunKeeper data on Twitter apply for 
other domains in which people self-track data and for other 
SAS. For example, GT study respondents felt that that many 
posts were made to brag or show off. We expect this occurs 
regularly  when  sharing  personal  informatics  data,  such  as 
when someone shares that they consumed fewer calories, lost 
weight,  or  cut  unnecessary  spending  habits.  However,  this 
might not be true for all domains. Some types of data, such 
as personal finances or health results, may be seen as more 
private,  but  in  some  cases  some  members  of  the  audience 
may  have  a  greater  desire  to  see  regular  updates,  such  as 
when  someone  has  had  an  ongoing  struggle  to  manage  a 
chronic illness [44]. Future work should more fully explore 
heterogeneity between different domains of shared data. 

Regardless of the data presented, we believe automatic posts 
from self-tracking applications are likely to receive negative 
reactions from audience members. While perhaps some types 
of personal data are less annoying or more interesting in a 
SAS – something future work should assess – we anticipate 
that adverse reactions to automatically generated posts will 
still be common. 

Audience  reactions  to  personal  informatics  posts  may 
correlate  to  how  frequently  these  posts  appear.  Current 
commercial  self-tracking  applications  including  Strava, 
Last.fm,  FourSquare  and  RunKeeper,  encourage  self-

trackers to post to SAS regularly. We believe changes to the 
design  of  these  applications  to  encourage  fewer,  more 
meaningful posts and descriptions of the post's importance or 
what sharers hope to gain from posting, will result in better 
sharing experiences for both sharers and their audiences. 

It not always correct to design personal informatics sharing 
features  to  maximize  post  audience.  Applications  should 
help sharers route frequent posts to the right audience. These 
posts should target people who will respond positively to the 
content and can offer reactions the sharers need, be tolerant 
or  even  desiring  of  seeing  it  more  frequently,  and  have 
sufficient  context  to  understand  it.  For  more  significant 
events, they might encourage posters to share more broadly 
and  to  provide  sufficient  context  so  the  audience  will 
understand why they are sharing. 

Use of the design dimension framework 
In this paper, we describe a framework for evaluating sharing 
features  in  personal  informatics  studies.  Use  of  this 
framework can help designers consider each design choice 
they  make  when  creating  a  sharing  feature  for  a  personal 
informatics application. 

We demonstrate the value of our design framework with a 
relatively simple and constrained sharing problem, varying 
only a single dimension (shared content) in our experiments. 
Thorough, empirical evaluation of a range of design options 
can  inform  the  design  of  such  features.  This  level  of 
evaluation  may  not  always  scale  to  investigating  to  less 
explored,  less  constrained  design  questions.  In  those 
situations, we believe that our framework and corresponding 
review  of  previous  literature  can  guide  designers  to  select 
and evaluate a smaller number of options. 

to  best  share  personal 

CONCLUSION 
This  paper  presents  a  sharing  dimension  framework  that 
characterizes  different  design  choices  for  features  that 
support socially sharing personal informatics data. Designers 
can  use  this  framework  determine  the  impact  of  a  single 
factor 
informatics  data,  and 
researchers can use it to identify unanswered questions and 
guide future study designs. We characterize prior work into 
these  dimensions  and  summarize  findings  made  in  each 
dimension. We offer design recommendations for improving 
sharing of physical activity on Twitter through two studies 
of RunKeeper, and extend these findings to other domains.
