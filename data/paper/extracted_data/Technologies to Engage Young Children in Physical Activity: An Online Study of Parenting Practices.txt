ABSTRACT 

This paper explores how parents use interactive technologies to 
encourage young  children  (under  the  age  of 5)  to  be physically 
active,  as  well  as  how  technologies  might  undermine  physical 
activity. Based on an analysis of 1528 posts made online on Reddit 
and Quora, we found that many parents regard time spent with 
technologies as time taken away from physical activity. However, 
we  also  identified  how  parents  appropriated  technology  to 
promote  physical  activity,  i.e.,  through  rewarding,  modelling, 
facilitating,  participating,  tracking  and  documenting.  We  hope 
these  practices  will  inspire  design  work  with  families  to  create 
new exertion  interfaces,  games,  and  persuasive technologies.  In 
framing our findings as practices, we hope to expand the focus of 
future  design  activities  from  narrow  concerns  with  health, 
tracking, and competition, towards broader concerns with what 
families  do  in  everyday  life,  how  they  socialize,  and  what 
resources and technologies they have available to flourish.

support  parents  in  creating  healthy  and  safe  routines  for  their 
children,  the  Australian  Government  recently  released  the 
“Australian  24-Hour  Movement  Guidelines  for  the  Early  Years 
(Birth  to  5  years)”  [25].  According  to  the  guidelines,  young 
children should not be restrained for more than 1 hour at a time 
(e.g.,  in  a  stroller).  Infants  should  be  physically  active  several 
times a day, e.g., through crawling or tummy time, and get 14 to 
17 hours of sleep. Toddlers (1-2 years) should get at least 3 hours 
of physical activity and 11 to 14 hours of sleep. Pre-schoolers (3-5 
years)  should  be  active  for  at  least  3  hours,  with  1  hour  of 
energetic play, and get 10 to 13 hours of sleep. Activities should 
be spread throughout the day; more physical activity is better [25]. 
Parents and interactive technology exert strong influence on 
children’s  lifestyles.  Parents  can  promote  physical  activity  in 
children by supporting activity and creating an environment free 
from  barriers,  by  encouraging  and  reinforcing  children  for 
physical  activity,  and  by being  an  active  role model  themselves 
[22,  39].  Preschool  children  who  receive  both  maternal  and 
paternal support are more physically active and eat more healthily 
than  other  children  [36].  Regarding  technology,  the  Australian 
movement  guidelines  recommend  no  screen  time  for  children 
under  the  age  of  2  years.  For  children  above  the  age  of  2  it  is 
recommended  to  replace  screen  time  with  other  activities  like 
reading,  singing  and puzzles [25].  However,  the  guidelines  also 
acknowledge  a  lack  of  research  on  sedentary  behaviour  and 
screen  time:  “No studies  examined newer/evolving  technologies 
that  contribute  to  sedentary  time  (e.g.,  tablets,  FaceTime/Skype, 
small screens)” [25, p. 182] 

To start addressing this issue, this paper presents a qualitative 
study of parenting practices and the influence of technologies on 
physical activity in children. Based on an analysis of 1528 online 
discussion  forum  posts  on  Reddit  and  Quora,  this  paper  shows 
how  parents  often  regard  time  spent  with  technologies  as  time 
taken  from  physical  activity.  However,  the  findings  also  show 
how  parents  employ  technologies  to  promote  physical  activity: 
parents used technology to reward children, to model and inspire 
active lifestyles, to facilitate playful activity, to encourage whole-
family participation, and to track and document physical activity. 
We  seek  to  offer  two  contributions  to  the  HCI  community. 
Firstly,  inspired  by  the  turn  to  practices  in  HCI  [17,  26]  and  a 
theory  of  parents’ physical  activity  practices  [22],  this research 
offers 
into  how  technologies  permeate  parenting 
practices.  Secondly,  we  hope  that  other  researchers  will  draw 
inspiration  from  these  practices  to  design  technologies  that  go 
beyond the commonly used design strategy of competition.

Technologies to Engage Young Children in Physical Activity 

OzCHI’18, December, 2018, Melbourne, VIC, Australia 

2  RELATED WORK 
Several areas of HCI research focus on the design of technology 
to promote physical activity, often by motivating people through 
competition.  Exertion  interfaces  encourage  intense  physical 
activity through digitally enhanced sports where people compete 
in jogging, table tennis, and soccer [23, 24]. Persuasive technology 
focuses on behaviour change through strategies like nudges, self-
monitoring,  simulations,  social  support,  and  competition  [6,  12, 
29, 31]. Location-based games like Pokémon Go [1]  and Woody 
[38]  have  shown  potential  for  short-term  increases  in  physical 
activity. Gamification through badges, scoreboards, and rewards 
is common to many designs that promote exercise, which again 
encourages  competition  [7,  15,  19,  35,  41].  Finally,  under  the 
umbrella  of  personal  informatics,  HCI  researchers  explore  how 
physical  activity  tracking  with  mobile  and  wearable  devices 
promotes knowledge and self-optimisation [18, 21, 32]. 

Some of these research areas have also investigated physical 
activity in family settings. Personal informatics has been explored 
in families with school-aged children [14, 27]. These studies show 
that family members can benefit from collaborating to track and 
manage  health  conditions  [27].  However,  these  studies  also 
highlight privacy tensions and the risk of potentially undermining 
the development of trust between children and parents [14, 27]. 
Video games like Kinect and Wii use the body as game controller. 
Studies in family homes show that these games can support rich 
social  experiences  and  exertion  [9].  Research  into  outdoor  play 
has examined how to enhance objects like sticks for throwing as 
well as enhancing playground equipment with technology [3, 13]. 
Focussing  specifically  on  preschool-children,  Saksono  et  al. 
[33, 34] have started to explore ways of encouraging interaction 
and  reflection  on  physical  activity  between  parents  and  young 
children. The design of Spaceship Launch [34] encouraged parents 
and  children  to  track  physical  activity  together  with  a  Fitbit 
device, and a game provided virtual rewards and encouragement. 
In  another  study  [33],  they  created  a  digital  storybook  that 
brought  reflection  on  physical  activity  into  stories  read  at 
bedtime. They found that some children were indeed reflecting on 
family  activities  and  personal  experiences.  However,  some 
children  found  it  hard  to  reflect  due  to  their  young  age  and 
developmental stage, while other children had limited experiences 
to  reflect  on,  or  they  brought  up  negative  experiences  which 
undermined their parents’ efforts to promote physical activity. 

HCI  research  is  also  exploring  how  parents  use  online 
information and social media for support. Many parents go online 
to  find  information  about  birth,  health  questions,  disciplining 
children,  purchase  suggestions,  and  education  [2,  28].  Finding 
information  online  allows  parents  to  access  a  wider  audience. 
Online  communities  like  Reddit  also  allow  parents  to  remain 
anonymous, which makes it easier to find answers to potentially 
embarrassing  questions  [2].  Social  network  sites  like  Facebook 
allow parents to ask for information and support from people they 
know,  or  with  whom  they  have  some  connection,  which  can 
enhance the credibility of information received [8]. Finally, social 
network  sites  are  also  a  place  for  parents  to  share  photos  and 
experiences and to exchange emotional support [10, 16] 

In  summary,  HCI  offers  a  large  body  of  research  on 
technologies  to  promote  physical  activity  or  to  find  relevant 
information,  but  research  focussed  on  families  with  young 
children is scarce. What is also missing from these studies, is an 
understanding  of  how  parents  employ  existing  technologies  in 
their  parenting  practices  to  engage  their  children  in  physical 
activity, as well as the possible adverse effects of technology. 

3  RESEARCH APPROACH 
The  aim  of  this  study  was  to  understand  how  parents  use 
technologies to encourage their children to be physically active, 
as well as how technologies might undermine physical activity. 

The study  was  based on  an  analysis  of 1528  posts  from two 
popular online discussion forums for parents: Reddit and Quora. 
Like  previous  studies  [2,  5,  20,  40],  we  found  that  these  online 
discussion forums provide a variety of perspectives on technology 
practices  related  to  parenting  and  wellbeing,  without  requiring 
additional input from participants. These forums are also openly 
accessible and easy to search. After receiving ethics approval from 
our  university,  the  first  author  browsed  through  all  parenting 
discussions  on  these  sites,  reaching  back  to  2012,  to  identify 
relevant posts. Keywords like exercise, sports, fitness, technology, 
apps, and video games were used to find further posts. A total of 
1528 relevant posts was retrieved and copied into Saturate [37], 
an online tool for data management and analysis. The length of 
posts varied from 3 to 921 words, with an average of 122 words. 

The  dataset  of  1528  online  discussion  forum  posts  was 
analysed based on the principles of a thematic analysis [4]. Initial 
codes  on  technology  influence  on  physical  activity  were 
generated  by  the  first  two  authors,  who  read  through  some 
discussions on paper, made annotations, and discussed emerging 
codes. The first author then applied these codes to the analysis in 
Saturate and continued with open coding. Themes were generated 
through an affinity diagram: codes were written on post-it notes 
and  clustered  on  a  whiteboard  to  identify  how  technology  was 
used to promote physical activity, barriers, and values. Guided by 
related literature on parenting [22, 39] and practice theory [11, 17, 
30],  we  refined  the  themes  to  highlight  different  sets  of 
technology-mediated  parenting practices:  rewarding,  modelling, 
facilitating, participating, tracking and documenting, which will 
be presented in the next section. 

We acknowledge that this sort of analysis is limited. We do not 
have interview data to provide contextual information about each 
family  who  posted  online,  or  to  check  that  the  discussion  only 
related to children under the age of 5. While this analysis aimed 
to present a variety of views, we do not suggest that the findings 
offer  a  representative  and  comprehensive  account  of  parenting 
practices. The number of posts coded is presented in each findings 
section  to  provide  context  about  the  prevalence  of  discussion 
topics  to  this  qualitative  analysis,  but  these  numbers  do  not 
indicate  actual  prevalence  of  practices.  Information  about  the 
source of a quote (R for Reddit or Q for Quora, and the discussion 
topic)  is  presented  in  brackets  after  each  quote  to  add  context 
about the online discussion. Places and names in quotes have been 
modified to protect the anonymity of online community members.

4  FINDINGS 

4.1  Technology as Displacement and Reward 
Technology  as  displacement  and  as  reward  can  be  seen  as  two 
sides of the same proverbial coin. On one side, technology creates 
the  challenge  of  time  displacement.  23  posts  featured  concerns 
that  time  spent  using  technology  is  time  taken  from  physical 
activity.  These  concerns  focussed  on  Internet,  TV,  and  video 
games, which were seen as a source of instant gratification that 
uniquely  draw  the  attention  of  children.  Some  discussions  also 
referred to the parents’ own childhood, comparing their relatively 
technology-free childhood with their own children’s situation. 

“Video  games  offer  a  sense  of  accomplishment, 
exploration, excitation,  etc. It  gives  a  rush  that  offline 
activities don't.” (R, video game addiction) 

On  the  other  side,  technology  provided  an  opportunity  for 
parents  to  reward  children  for  physical  activity  (8  posts). 
According to parents, access to TV, Internet, and video games (as 
well as new toys or praise) provided an incentive for their children 
to by physically active, play outside, or do household chores.  

“One  thing  I've  found  that  works  is  'buy  in'  for  video 
games.  For  every  hour  of  physical  work/play  you  do 
away from a screen, you get 15 minutes of video games.” 
(R, addiction to video games) 
“We're  avid  geocachers.  We  don't  plan  a  hike  unless 
there's a geocache that I’ve researched to make sure it's 
likely to have a toy inside for them.” (R, hiking) 

4.2  Modelling and Inspiring Active Lifestyles 
Parents  can  encourage  physical  activity  in  their  children  by 
modelling  a  healthy,  active  lifestyle.  We  found  41  posts  where 
parents reported that they sought to encourage their children to 
be active by setting a good example themselves, e.g., by walking, 
jogging,  and  working  out  in  the  gym.  Two  further  posts 
mentioned that friends and relatives can also be role models. 

“We model  a healthy  lifestyle  as much  as  we  can…. A 
onetime  conversation  about  healthy  living most  likely 
will have little effect but modelling will help to instil it.” 
(R, right time to teach kids about healthy lifestyle) 

Similar to modelling, parents used technologies to inspire their 
children to engage in physical activity (7 posts). Parents reported 
that videos of other children being active, documentaries of sports 
stars, and videos educating about healthy lifestyles were effective 
in getting their children more active. 

“I started showing her YouTube videos of kids around 
her age riding balance bikes. And that kind of got her 
started. The thing that was most effective in getting her 
to try  it for  a  longer  period  of  time  was her watching 
her dad to leave on a bike ride.” (R, exercise for toddlers) 

4.3  Facilitating Playful Activity 
Parents highlighted that physical activity needs to be playful (40 
posts). Rather than framing physical activity as exercise regimes 
or  as  a  health  need,  activities  for  children  need  to  framed  as 

playful  and  fun.  Parents  discussed  how  they  facilitated  playful 
activity  by  employing  games  like hide  and seek,  playing  with  a 
ball, rolling down a grassy hill, and dressing up as superheroes. 

“It has to be 'active play' and not 'exercise activity'. The 
most important thing you can do is get the 2-year-old to 
enjoy moving. Grown-ups often shun 'activity' because 
having been forced into it. When something becomes a 
'must'  it  tends  to  drain  out  the  'fun'.”  (Q,  exercise 
activities for toddlers) 

Technologies  were  often  discussed  by  parents  as  a  way  of 
facilitating playful activities for their children (28 posts). Several 
parents suggested game consoles like the Nintendo Wii system to 
encourage indoor exercise. Some parents had downloaded mobile 
apps and YouTube videos that engaged their children in exercise, 
yoga,  and dance. One parent  added  a  shelf  with  a  laptop to her 
treadmill so that her children can walk and play video games. 

“My 4yo daughter loves the Super Stretch Yoga app. She 
will pull it up and do it on her own.” (R, fitness apps) 
“There's  a  show  on  the  CBeebies  (preschool  BBC 
channel) called Waybuloo where they do ‘yoga’ with the 
kids. My sons love it and roll around on the floor trying 
to do the stretches.” (R, fitness apps for children) 

4.4  Participating in Activity as a Family 
The most direct form of encouraging physical activity in children 
is  to  be  active  together  as  a  family.  We  found  15  posts  where 
parents  reported  on  activities  that  worked  for  them  or  on  their 
intentions to get the whole family to go for a walk, a bicycle ride, 
or a swim. Some parents involved their children in choosing and 
planning these activities to ensure their interest. 

“We hike every weekend with our 4 and 2.5 years old.” 
(R, hiking with young children) 

A  range  of  technology  options  were  discussed  that  allow 
parents  and  children  to  participate  in  physical  activity  together 
(14  posts).  A  common  theme  was  playing  video  games  that 
encourage exercise or dance as a family. Some parents had mobile 
apps  for  exercise  or  yoga  that  they  used  together  with  their 
children. A final theme was that parents and children use mobile 
phones to enhance walks, e.g., through location-based games like 
Pokémon Go that invite them to catch virtual creatures. 

“Do you have a video game system? [Kinect] Just Dance 
makes  all  of  us  sweat  and  gasp  for  air  after  a  while.”  
(R, exercise inside the house) 
“My  two  boys  and  I  went  on  a  Pokémon hunt on  our 
way  to  the park. My  oldest  (4yo)  caught  a  ratatta  and 
my youngest (3yo) caught a spearow. My observations: 
… Watch where you are going! This is a great exercise 
to teach kids young to be aware of their surroundings 
when they are looking at their phone. The park we were 
playing  in  is nice  and  open  with  lots of  room  for safe 
walking and exploring. I would give little reminders of, 
"Hey!  What's  to  your  right?"  And  make  them 
acknowledge something.” (R, Pokémon Go)

Technologies to Engage Young Children in Physical Activity 

OzCHI’18, December, 2018, Melbourne, VIC, Australia 

Safety  concerns  were  commonly  raised  online  (25  posts). 
Technologies  can  introduce  risks  for  children’s  safety.  For 
example, the Pokémon Go example above highlights that mobile 
phones  introduce  the  risk  of  diverting  attention  from  the 
environment to the phone. However, the example also shows that 
parental  participation  provides  an  opportunity  to  help  children 
become  more  mindful  of  where  they  are  walking.  Beyond that, 
parents often raised concerns that their children lacked access to 
safe  environments  for  physical  activity,  because  they  lacked 
access  to  gardens  and  parks,  or  because  the  roads  and 
neighbourhoods were not deemed safe. 

“As  winter  approaches,  I  am  growing  nervous  about 
how  to  ensure  my  almost-2-year-old  gets  enough 
physical activity in our small home. There aren't a lot of 
places I can take her in our community to run and play, 
so  I'm  interested  in  hearing  what  others  do  in  your 
homes  to get  your  toddlers  active  and moving.  I have 
tried "dance party" time with her, but so far, she is not 
really into it.” (R, indoor toddler activities) 

4.5  Tracking and Documenting Activity 
Technology was discussed by parents to track and document their 
children’s  physical  activity.  Discussions  of  tracking  (3  posts) 
focussed on the ability of technology to quantify exercise, e.g., by 
counting steps through  wearable  technology  like  Fitbit.  Parents 
were not necessarily interested in monitoring their children but 
rather suggested that children could use technology to set goals 
and to compete with others. It is important to note that all these 
posts were suggestions, rather than accounts of parents who had 
actually used tracking with their children.  

“Get them Fitbits and make it a contest to see who can 
get the most steps.” (Q, encourage children to exercise) 

Documenting is similar to tracking in that technology is used 
to  capture  physical  activity  (4  posts).  Unlike  with  tracking,  the 
focus  is  not  on  quantifying  and  analysing  activity.  Instead 
children  or  parents  capture  activities,  people,  and  environment 
through  photos  and  video  recordings.  Engagement  in  this  way 
goes beyond the exercise activity itself, allowing children to role-
play, edit photos and videos, and to share them with others.  

“I get them to run around in circles chasing and having 
a laugh under the pretence of turning it into some kind 
of action game for them to watch and participate in the 
editing  of.  They  always  come  back  from  the  park 
exhausted and have a lot of fun, every time one is done 
they are eager to start the next and have begun to start 
climbing  things  and  doing  random  gymnastics  while 
asking  me  to  film  it.”  (R,  inspire  children  to  exercise 
rather than play video games) 
“See if she wants to go on a walk or pick flowers or get 
her see if she'd like to photograph some new things. I 
feel like 95% of girls dig photography.” (R, weight loss) 

5  DISCUSSION 
This  study  provides 
into  how  technologies  are 
incorporated  into  parenting  practices,  as  well  how  technologies 

insights 

undermine efforts to encourage children to be physically active. 
Based  on  online  discussions  by  parents,  we  found  that 
technologies,  especially  video  games  and  TV,  can  displace 
physical  activity  time.  However,  the  findings  also  highlighted 
how parents have harnessed technologies to engage their children 
in  physical  activity:  as  a  reward  for  physical  activity,  to  model 
active lifestyles, to provide inspiration, to facilitate playful and fun 
activities, to encourage participation from the whole family, and 
to  track  and  document  physical  activity.  These  findings  extend 
previous  work  on  physical  activity  parenting  practices  [22],  by 
like 
showing  how

findings 
highlight  how  mobile  technologies  enable  new  practices  where 
children document activities through photos and videos.

can 

In framing our findings as practices, we also sought to shift the 
focus of physical activity away from pure concerns about health 
towards  a  more  holistic  understanding  of  what  families  do  in 
everyday  life,  how  they  interact,  the  recourses  they  have 
available, and how technologies are appropriated [17, 26]. From 
this perspective, it was encouraging to see that digital games like 
Pokémon  Go  were  appropriated  for  family  outings  and  nature 
exploration. Likewise, the findings highlighted that documenting 
and  tracking  was  less  focussed  on  the  personal  informatics 
approach of counting steps [18], but rather on how outdoor and 
play activities provide opportunities for creative engagement with 
visual media to document and share experiences. 

The  findings  also highlight  that  technologies  that  encourage 
physical  activity  do  not  have  to  be  limited  just  to  competition, 
which  appears  to  be  central  to  many  persuasive  technologies, 
gamified designs, and exertion games [6, 23, 24, 41]. Competition 
played  only  a  minor  part  in  our  findings.  Parents  suggested 
competition in combination with activity tracking, but they had 
not tried it out with their own children. Furthermore, competition 
may  have  been  part  playing  physical  video  games  like  Kinect. 
Similar  to  prior  research  [9],  we  found  that  even  in  these 
instances, parents viewed game play primarily as an opportunity 
to be active together and to socialize, rather than as a competition. 
This is not to say that competition may not be a motivating factor. 
However,  there  are  many  other  practices  that  parents  employ: 
encouragement,  co-participation,  and  free  play,  which  provide 
opportunities for designing technology.  

6  CONCLUSIONS 
This  article  started  with  the  premise  that  less  time  spent  with 
digital  technology  and more  time spent being  physical  active  is 
best  for  the  health  and  development  of  young  children.  In 
analysing the online discussions of parents, we have indeed found 
that  time  with  technology  is  often  seen  as  time  taken  from 
that  parents 
physical  activity.  However,  we  also 
appropriated  technology  to  promote  physical  activity,  ranging 
from using it as a reward to co-participation to documentation. 

found 

Online  discussions  have  provided  a  good  starting  point  to 
understand the practices and concerns of parents. However, more 
work is needed to engage with families in situ, both to understand 
their practices and contexts, as well as to design technologies that 
allow children and parents to flourish.
