ABSTRACT
The growing amount of data collected by quantiﬁed self tools
and social media hold great potential for applications in per-
sonalized medicine. Whereas the ﬁrst includes health-related
physiological signals, the latter provides insights into a user’s
behavior. However, the two sources of data have largely been
studied in isolation. We analyze public data from users who
have chosen to connect their MyFitnessPal and Twitter ac-
counts. We show that a user’s diet compliance success, mea-
sured via their self-logged food diaries, can be predicted us-
ing features derived from social media:
linguistic, activity,
and social capital. We ﬁnd that users with more positive affect
and a larger social network are more successful in succeeding
in their dietary goals. Using a Granger causality methodol-
ogy, we also show that social media can help predict daily
changes in diet compliance success or failure with an accu-
racy of 77%, that improves over baseline techniques by 17%.
We discuss the implications of our work in the design of im-
proved health interventions for behavior change.

INTRODUCTION
In his State of the Union address on January 20, 2015, Pres-
ident Obama announced the Precision Medicine Initiative
(PMI)1. The vision for precision medicine is a world where
variability in the lifestyle, physiology, genes, and environ-
mental context for each person can be accurately measured,
understood, and utilized in the prevention and treatment of

diseases. Making this vision a reality for all, in a scalable and
cost-effective manner, depends on advancing the science of
measurement, novel ways to harvest health related data, and
methods to infer health risk [5, 11]. Consequently, Estrin [20]
and Haddadi et al. [26] have recently emphasized the need for
the development of computational approaches that integrate
multiple forms of sensed data to improve understanding of
health and wellness.

Two such forms of sensed data that have been individually
observed to comprise valuable signals about health and well-
being, include social media and quantiﬁed self sensing tech-
nologies. Speciﬁcally, in the case of the former, the contin-
ual adoption of social media sites is presenting opportunities
toward pro-active and unobtrusive assessment and improve-
ment of our health and well-being at scale. These include,
observing behaviors and psychological states [16], depres-
sive tendencies [17], ﬁtness and diet [1, 57, 58, 56] and so
on. At the same time, we are seeing a rapid increase in the
adoption and use of lifelogging and self-tracking tools, pop-
ularly known as the quantiﬁed self movement [36]. A variety
of applications have emerged, that allow people to use their
mobile phones to track aspects of physical (e.g., step count,
sleep [37]), physiological (e.g., heart rate, respiration rate [6])
and behavioral health (e.g., affect, depression, stress [32]).
However, despite the vision outlined by the PMI1, there is
a dearth of work examining the relationship between these
different forms of data and in combining them for positive
health behavior change. Many health behaviors, e.g., addic-
tion or obesity, have social, behavioral, cognitive and affec-
tive dimensions. Information about these constructs can be
obtained from social media, but would be difﬁcult to observe
using quantiﬁed self sensing technologies alone. Similarly,
quantiﬁed self sensing technologies provide rich data about
ﬁne-grained and self-reported physiological attributes, which
are difﬁcult to derive from social media alone.

Through this paper, we aim to address some of these gaps in
health data integration. We explore the relationship between
quantiﬁed self sensing based markers of health, and one’s so-
cial behavioral, cognitive and affective context, as gleaned
through social media. Speciﬁcally, we study diet compliance
of individuals as self-journaled on a quantiﬁed self platform,
and complementarily examine the social media activities of
the same cohort. Our two speciﬁc research questions include:

Session: Tracking Activity & HealthCSCW 2017, February 25–March 1, 2017, Portland, OR, USA1334RQ 1: Are there behavioral measures derived from social me-
dia that are predictive of diet compliance success or failure?

RQ 2: To what extent can social media derived measures
be integrated with sensed historical data about dietary prac-
tices, in order to better assess future diet compliance?

Towards these goals, we leverage public data from a set of
individuals who have chosen to connect their quantiﬁed self
sensing and social media accounts. Our data comprises over
100K daily entries shared by nearly 700 individuals on a
calorie and diet logging application, MyFitnessPal (MFP)2,
and over 2M Twitter posts shared by the same individuals.
With this data, we deﬁne six different metrics for diet compli-
ance, based on relationships between self-reported daily calo-
rie goals and self-reported calories consumed. We also extract
a number of measures to characterize an individual’s behavior
on Twitter: linguistic, activity and social capital measures.

We ﬁrst build statistical models to examine the relationship
between social media derived measures and sensed informa-
tion about diet compliance success and failure. To answer
the second research question, we develop multivariate vector
auto-regressive models [25] of diet compliance of individuals
over time. Next, we apply a Granger causality analysis [24]
based methodology to examine the gain in predictive power
enabled by utilizing measurements of social media behavior,
alongside using sensed data on diet alone.

Our ﬁndings reveal signiﬁcant links between social media be-
havioral measures and diet compliance. Successful individ-
uals tend to post more positively (and correspondingly less
negatively, with less anger, anxiety and sadness), exhibit high
cognitive functioning, demonstrate collective attention, and
tend to be future oriented in the tone of their shared posts.
These individuals also show greater access to social capital
and heightened tendency for social interaction. We ﬁnd that
use of social media data can promisingly predict several diet
compliance metrics (accuracy=77%), with improvements in
accuracy up to 37% compared to baseline models. Finally,
our Granger causality based auto-regressive models indicate
that integrating social media data in predicting future diet
compliance can improve prediction accuracies by 17%, over
models that use historical data on diet compliance alone.

Our ﬁndings situate the signiﬁcance of integrating quantiﬁed
self sensing and social media data in predicting a speciﬁc yet
important health behavior—diet compliance. We discuss the
implications of our computational approaches and observa-
tional ﬁndings in deﬁning next generation health interven-
tions for positive behavior change.

RELATED WORK

Role of Technology in Health and Wellness
A rich body of work has studied the role of quantiﬁed self
sensing technologies in empowering individuals with data
about their health and well-being. This has included focusing
on attributes that are predictive of behavior change —for in-
stance, the role of self-efﬁcacy [49], motivational interview-
ing, perceived barriers, vulnerability, social norms [47], self-
monitoring, rewards and goal-setting [50, 37]. To this end,
gamiﬁcation of quantiﬁed self technologies have also been

proposed [59]. In a CHI 2014 workshop, Meyer et al. [36]
examined notions that trade-off the cost and value of such
technologies. In a more recent work, Murnane et al. [39] pro-
vided a categorization of popular mobile health applications
and then examined the perceived efﬁcacy of apps alongside
the reasons behind their adoption and abandonment. Ivanov
et al. [28] examined the factors that inﬂuence the sharing of
health-tracking records by patients with different categories
of acquaintances.

Quantiﬁed self sensing data has also been employed to assess
a number of health and well-being attributes of individuals.
Researchers have used various sensors to monitor changes
and predict trends of physiological and physical signals [4,
30]. Wearable sensing technologies that detect galvanic skin
response (GSR) signals, movement, respiration and heart rate
measurements have also been found to provide valuable phys-
iological data on challenges like stress and anxiety [32, 2].
Recently, the StudentLife Project [55, 8] leveraged passive
and active sensing techniques through the use of smartphones
among college students. Activity and behavioral data col-
lected through this methodology was then correlated to aca-
demic performance. Although rudimentary Facebook proﬁle
information was obtained through the mobile phone applica-
tion, this data was not analyzed.

Our work is related to the work of Weber and Achananu-
parp [57], who examined publicly accessible MyFitnessPal
food diaries to build models that can predict diet success and
caloric intake based on reported food categories. While this
work highly relevant to our investigations in this paper, we
examine the role of social and linguistic attributes, derived
from social media, in making and helping improve inferences
of diet compliance success and failure of individuals.

Health Information Sharing on Social Media
Online communities thriving on social media have also been
found to allow people afﬂicted by medical conditions to con-
nect with others and ﬁnd support [21, 40]. Additionally,
these communities serve a range of purposes, including seek-
ing advice [29], connecting with experts and individuals with
similar experiences [21, 27], sharing questions and concerns
around treatment options [21], sensemaking [33] and under-
standing professional diagnoses [27], enabling better man-
agement of chronic health conditions [34], and fueling dis-
cussions with healthcare providers [21].

In other works, Vickey and Breslin [53] conducted a system-
level study of how ﬁtness app data is shared on Twitter.
Teodoro and Naaman [51] performed a qualitative analysis
of Twitter posts, as well as conducting interviews with ex-
perienced users who post messages about exercise, diet, and
weight loss activities. Their goal was to identify what moti-
vates people to share such content on social media. Recently,
Park et al. [43] studied the traits of users who share their per-
sonal health and ﬁtness related information on Twitter via the
MyFitnessPal application. They observed that persistent shar-
ing of such health status updates on Twitter was correlated
with health-related linguistic attributes, as well as presence
of a ﬁtness-oriented support network. Close to our work is
also the recent work of Wang et al. [56], wherein the authors

Session: Tracking Activity & HealthCSCW 2017, February 25–March 1, 2017, Portland, OR, USA1335examined weight updates shared on Twitter via a Withings
internet-enabled smart scale. Akbar and Weber [3] present a
similar study on sleep duration and quality. They track auto-
generated tweets from a sleep-recording mobile app to con-
nect a user’s sleep behavior to their social media feed.

This body work is valuable to our investigation, because it
provides evidence linking social media use and one’s health
and well-being. While most of this work focuses on using
qualitative methods, in our paper, we adopt a computational
approach to build models that are able to examine in what
ways one’s behavior, affect, activities and language on Twitter
may relate to diet success or failure.

Assessing Health Status from Social Media
Considerable research has focused on developing approaches
that can (semi-)automatically assess health and wellness
states using social media. These include Twitter-based topic
models to identify conditions and symptoms related to dis-
eases [44], postpartum depression [16], depressive disor-
ders [17], eating disorders [7], suicidal ideation [18], addic-
tive behaviors and subtance abuse [38], as well as a variety of
county-level health statistics [15].

Online data also been employed to infer dietary practices,
food consumption, and taste preferences of individuals and
populations [54, 35]. For instance, Wagner et al. [54] an-
alyzed data from an online recipe platform to understand
the association between geographic proximity and shared di-
etary preferences and the extent to which temporal informa-
tion helps to predict these preferences. Twitter and Facebook
posts [1] as well as the content of Instagram images [23] have
further been found to correlate with CDC reported prevalence
of obesity in different geographical regions, as well as in
helping infer caloric and nutrient consumption. Weber and
Mejova [58], recently showed the feasibility of using crowd-
sourcing to infer body weight categories from proﬁle pictures
shared on Twitter.

Relevant to our study is the recent work of Padrez et al. [42]
wherein the authors linked social media and medical record
data to determine the acceptability to patients and potential
utility to researchers of a database linking patients’ social me-
dia content with their electronic medical record (EMR) data.

In our work we extend the above line of research by integrat-
ing social media with self-reported information about caloric
goals and consumption on the MyFitnessPal platform.
In
this way, we believe our approach will be able to comple-
ment state-of-the-science health assessment tools to give rich,
detailed, difﬁcult to measure observations about context and
content of social interactions, social capital, and exposure to
online cues that may alleviate or mediate an individual’s suc-
cess or failure toward their ﬁtness or dietary goal.

DATA

Collecting MyFitnessPal and Twitter Data
We utilize self-reported information about calorie goals, in-
take and consumption shared via the popular smartphone ap-
plication MyFitnessPal2 as our source of quantiﬁed self sens-

ing data. The app (henceforth MFP) allows users to track
their diet and exercise in a diary form to determine optimal
caloric intake and nutrients for the users’ goals. MFP also al-
lows users to share their updates on their Facebook or Twitter
proﬁles, thereby creating a link to their social media activity.
It might seem that MFP is not a typical source of “sensed”
data as outlined in the literature [20], however since we un-
obtrusively and non-invasively collect and utilize this data as
a stream of information relating to one’s diet, it may be con-
sidered to be sensed.

We focus on MFP data shared by users in their food diaries,
that includes detailed daily caloric and nutrient information
about food items consumed, total calorie consumed, and the
calorie goal for the all of the meals of the day. For instance, on
a certain day the MFP food diary of a user could record that
their calorie goal for the day was 1,400, and they consumed a
total of 1,463 calories in all. Thus the user exceeded their goal
by 63 calories. A screenshot of the app is shown in Figure 1.

Collection Methodology. We adopted a bootstrapping
methodology to ﬁnd users who have cross-posted their MFP
diary updates on Twitter. Following manual inspection, we
found that typically, the Twitter cross-postings of MFP diary
updates have a predictable structured format containing the
hashtag “#myﬁtnesspal” and including a shortened link, that
points to the post author’s online MFP diary (e.g., “completed
his food and exercise diary for 4/22/2016 and was under his
calorie goal <bit.ly URL> #myﬁtnesspal”). To get this
data, we used the ofﬁcial Streaming API of Twitter3 to ﬁnd
publicly shared posts with the hashtag “#myﬁtnesspal” and
containing an embedded link (e.g., “bit.ly”). From this candi-
date set of over 1,000 posts shared over a week long period in
early 2016, we extracted the unique usernames and expanded
the MFP diary links included in the posts.

Thereafter, we undertook two parallel tasks: (1) Obtaining
the entire timeline (or the most recent 3,200 posts) of each

Twitter user using the Twitter API; and (2) Obtaining the
content (or the parsed HTML page source) for each of the
extracted MFP diary links, whose content was publicly ac-
cessible. We were able to obtain Twitter post timeline in-
formation for 1,038 users who still had their account ac-
tive/public at the time of data collection, yielding 2,249,297
posts (mean posts/user=2,166.9; median posts/user=2,839).
Separately, after data cleaning, we were able to obtain a to-
tal of 109,920 MFP diary entries of 698 users from the links.
For 692 users, we had both their Twitter data and MFP diary
data. We aligned the MFP and Twitter data for each of these
users by considering the timestamps of their MFP entries and
Twitter posts. Concretely, for a speciﬁc user, we considered
only those of their MFP and Twitter posts that lay within the
largest overlapping timestamp range with consecutive daily
data from both data sources.

Data Cleaning. We further cleaned the above dataset, espe-
cially focusing on MFP food diary entries whose calorie goals
or calorie consumed values were more than two standard de-
viations away from the user’s mean calorie goal/consumed:
(1) We removed two individual MFP food diary entries since
they reported unusually large calorie goals (∼1 million). (2)
We excluded MFP entries for whom the absolute difference
between calorie goal and consumption was greater than 3,000
calories, since we suspected this might indicate misreporting
of either goals or consumption, or speciﬁc individuals with
extra-ordinary dietary/ﬁtness regimes. (3) We additionally re-
moved one user since they had all their calorie goals set to 0.
In the rest of the paper, we will use this set of 691 users.

Data Descriptive Statistics
We present some descriptive statistics of the data we collected
above. For the 691 users, the mean and median number of
MFP food diary entries per user were 157.5, and 122, indi-
cating the presence of sufﬁcient and temporally spread diet
data. Figure 2 gives the distribution. Among all of the MFP
entries, we had 88,982 entries where the calorie consump-
tion was under the calorie goal, and 20,103 where the con-
sumption was greater than the goal. In Figure 2 we also show
the distribution of this difference over MFP food diary en-
tries. Additionally, the distribution of the number of users
over their mean calorie goal and calorie consumption across

all MFP entries is given in Figure 3. Interestingly, we observe
that users whose calorie consumption was, in general, under
their goal, had more MFP entries (µ = 129.1; σ = 110.5),
than those for whom the mean consumption was more than
their goal (µ = 33.6; σ = 45.4). This aligns with prior ﬁnd-
ings that indicate that individuals who tend to be successful
in meeting their dietary goals, tend to be persistent users of
the MyFitnessPal platform [57].

METHODS

Deﬁning Measures of Diet Compliance
Before proposing our methods, we ﬁrst deﬁne a number of
metrics of diet compliance “success” and “failure” for the
users in our data, based on suitably chosen empirical thresh-
olds that were found to distinctively demarcate the success
and failure classes. Note that the six measures deﬁned below
are independent of each other, i.e., a user is assessed to be
successful or not based on each individual measure. Below
we provide deﬁnitions of the measures – based on a users’
MFP dairy entries until day t, their success/failure label at t
is determined as:
• Success:

if the mean caloric consumption of the user is
under 2,000 calories until day t — this threshold is cho-
sen based on the typical diet of a moderately active adult
released by the USDA4; Failure: if the mean caloric con-
sumption is over 2,000 calories.

• Success: if the mean calorie consumed by the user is under
their mean calorie goal over all days until t; Failure: if it is
over the goal set by the user.

• Success: if the mean calorie consumed is 25% or more un-
der the mean calorie goal over all days until t; Failure: if it
is over this threshold.

• Success: if the mean calorie consumed is 50% or more un-
der the mean calorie goal over all days until t; Failure: if it
is over this threshold.

• Success:

if the user’s calorie consumption was less than
the corresponding calorie goal for at least 50% of the days
until t; Failure: if the consumption was above the goal for
more than 50% of the days.

We additionally consider two measures of user activity: (1)
Interactivity, as given by the fraction of @-replies in a user’s
timeline of posts on Twitter; and (2) Information sharing, as
given by the fraction of posts containing an external link. Our
ﬁnal two measures assess a user’s social capital, given by the
number of in-links (followers) in their ego-centric network on
Twitter, and the number of out-links (followees).

based on the different diet compliance metrics.

Analytic Techniques

• Success:

if the user’s calorie consumption was less than
the corresponding calorie goal for at least 75% of the days
until t; Failure: if the consumption was above the goal for
more than 25% of the days.

Refer to Table 1 for information on the distribution of success
and failure user classes obtained by employing the above six
measures in our MFP data. Here, each user’s whole overlap-
ping range of MFP and Twitter data was used as the period
of consideration. We note imbalance in class sizes for some
measures, including a heightened propensity for success – the
implications of these data artifacts are presented in the Dis-
cussion section.

Social Media Behavioral Measures
We now identify various attributes to characterize the behav-
ior manifested through the Twitter posts of the MFP users.
We consider three categories of linguistic measures: (1) af-
fective attributes, (2) cognitive attributes, and (3) linguis-
tic style attributes. These measures are largely based on the
psycholinguistic lexicon LIWC5, and were motivated from
prior literature that examines associations between the be-
havioral expression of individuals and their health and well-
being [9]. For our experiments we used the 2015 version of
the LIWC dictionary.

(1) We consider two measures of affect derived from LIWC:
positive affect (PA), and negative affect (NA), and four other
measures of emotional expression: anger, anxiety, sadness,
and swear.

(2) We use LIWC to deﬁne cognitive measures as well: (a)
cognition, comprising cognitive mech, discrepancies, inhibi-
tion, negation, causation, certainty, and tentativeness words;
and (b) perception, comprising a set of words in LIWC
around see, hear, feel, percept, insight, and relative.

(3) Next, we consider four measures of linguistic style: (a)
Lexical Density: consisting of words that are verbs, auxil-
iary verbs, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, articles, in-
clusive, and exclusive. (b) Temporal References: consist-
ing of past, present, and future tenses. (c) Social/Personal
Concerns: words belonging to family, friends, social, work,
health, humans, religion, bio, body, money, achievement,
home, sexual, and death. (d) Interpersonal Awareness and
Focus: words that are 1st person singular, 1st person plural,
2nd person, and 3rd person pronouns.

Models for Diet Compliance Success and Failure
To address RQ 1, we propose statistical models to predict a
user’s diet compliance success or failure using the proposed
social media measures. Speciﬁcally, we build six different
regularized logistic regression models (we employ ridge re-
gression): one corresponding to each diet compliance met-
ric. The goal of these logistic regression models is to ex-
plain, model, and classify the social media attributes of MFP
users who succeed or fail in diet compliance. Thus the mod-
els use the diet compliance success/failure labels (BASELINE
, CALDIFF , CALDIFF:25 , CALDIFF:50 , PROPDAYS:50 ,
and PROPDAYS:75 respectively) of all user over all of their
MFP entries as the response variable. Thereafter, as explana-
tory variables, we consider the three sets of social media mea-
sures: language, activity, and social capital. Note that, we
excluded any tokens in posts that contained the string “my-
ﬁtnesspal”, in order to not corrupt the explanatory variables
with information about the response variable.

To evaluate the goodness of ﬁts of our six models, we use
deviance. Brieﬂy put, deviance is a measure of the lack of
ﬁt to data, hence lower values are better. It is calculated by
comparing a model with the saturated model—a model with a
theoretically perfect ﬁt, which we consider to be the intercept-
only model and refer to as Null. Additionally, we perform
k-fold cross validation (k = 5) determine the best tuning of
the model parameters, and also to prevent overﬁtting to the
dataset. It also helps us assess the performance of the models
in predicting diet compliance success and failure on unseen
test data. We evaluate model performance here through the
metrics accuracy, precision, and recall.

Granger Causality Analysis
Next, per RQ 2, we are concerned with the question whether
social media data correlates with temporal changes in diet
compliance, deﬁned by our various metrics of success and
failure6. To answer this question, we adopt the economet-
ric technique of Granger causality analysis [24] to the daily
time series produced by the Twitter speciﬁc measures, ver-
sus success or failure in diet compliance. Granger causality
analysis rests on the assumption that if a variable X causes Y
then changes in X will systematically occur before changes
in Y . We will thus ﬁnd that the lagged values of X will ex-
hibit a statistically signiﬁcant correlation with Y . We note
that here, correlation however does not prove causation; we
are merely testing whether one time series has predictive in-
formation about the other.

6Since here we are studying the temporal changes in diet compliance
and its relationship to social media, we compute daily diet compli-
ance metrics of each user, instead of over the entire period.

Session: Tracking Activity & HealthCSCW 2017, February 25–March 1, 2017, Portland, OR, USA1338For our task, we propose two different lagged multivariate
vector auto-regressive (VAR) models for each compliance
metric [25]. Our ﬁrst model is meant to forecast success (or
failure) on day tk based on (i) success/failure in compliance
over n previous days (tk−1, tk−2, ..., tk−n), as well as (ii)
the number of calories consumed over tk−1, tk−2, ..., tk−n.
the same, but using
The second model would forecast
n lagged values of both success/failure and calories con-
sumed, along with all of the three categories of social me-
dia derived measures (language, activity, social capital) over
tk−1, tk−2, ..., tk−n. Using the log likelihood metric of the
models, we propose to assess the role of social media—the
second model would enable better forecast of diet compliance
if the log likelihood of the model is higher than the ﬁrst.

Next, we statistically establish whether the second model,
that uses social media data, indeed improves our diet com-
pliance forecasting ability over the one that uses MFP data
alone. For this purpose, we utilize the Granger causality
test [24]. The Granger causality test is a statistical hypothesis
test to determine whether a time series X (the predictor vari-
able, or MFP or linguistic, activity, social capital measures)
is useful in forecasting another time series Y (the predicted
variable, or diet compliance success/failure) by attempting to
reject the null hypothesis that X does not help predict, i.e.,
Granger-cause, Y . The alternative hypothesis is that adding
X does help predict Y .

However we note in our case, we cannot apply the traditional
Granger causality test, as the time series we intend to fore-
cast, say, Y is not a vector over time, but a set of such vectors
spanning multiple MFP users. Hence, we adopt methods for
generalizing Granger causality to sets of time series, where m
time series (X) Granger-cause m other time series (Y ) [24].
Speciﬁcally, we use canonical-correlation analysis (CCA) as
a multivariate statistical technique that has been applied to
Granger causality analysis to infer information ﬂow between
sets of time series [41]. It ﬁnds linear combinations of the
predictor (X) and predicted variables (Y ) which have maxi-
mum correlation with each other.

After applying the CCA, we propose to examine the null hy-
pothesis stated above; in other words, if any of the different
predictor variables X is less than a chosen level of signiﬁ-
cance α. For this purpose, we will use the F -statistic and the
Wilks’ statistic [48]. If there is at least one such variable, one
would conclude that Granger causality is present, i.e., there
is a predictor variable (MFP or Twitter measure) that leads to
the predicted outcome (diet compliance success/failure).

RESULTS

RQ 1: What Predicts Diet Compliance?
In Table 2 we report a summary of the different model ﬁts.
For each of the six diet compliance metrics, we build three
models using the various Twitter derived measures—(i) lan-
guage measures only, (ii) language and activity measures, and
(iii) all of the language, activity and social measures. Due
to the randomness introduced by cross-validation, we report
the results corresponding to the lowest deviances that we ob-
tained in any of the runs.

Table 2: Summary of different model ﬁts. Null is the
intercept-only model. For each model, we also report the log
likelihood (LL) and the p-value of statistical signiﬁcance.

Examining Model Fits. Compared to the Null models, all
of our models provide explanatory power with signiﬁcant im-
provements in deviances in predicting the six diet compliance
metrics: BASELINE , CALDIFF , CALDIFF:25 , CALDIFF:50
, PROPDAYS:50 , and PROPDAYS:75 . The difference be-
tween the deviance of a Null model and the deviances of each
of the other models approximately follows a χ2 distribution,
with degrees of freedom equal to the number of additional
variables in the more comprehensive model. E.g., compar-
ing the deviance of the model that uses Language + Activ-
ity measures in predicting CALDIFF:25 with that of the Null
model, we see that the information provided by these mea-
sures has signiﬁcant explanatory power: χ2(51, N = 613) =
1164.7 − 703.4 = 461.3, p < 10−6.

We observe similar deviance results when we compare the set
of three models (Language, Language + Activity, Language
+ Activity + Social) corresponding to each diet compliance
metric: the latter models give better ﬁts. This is further ap-
parent in the measures of the log likelihood given by the three
models corresponding to each diet compliance metric. For in-
stance, the log likelihood of the Language, Language + Activ-
ity, Language + Activity + Social model in predicting CALD-
IFF:50 is 91.3% higher than that given by the model that uses
language measures only. This indicates that the three cat-
egories of measures derived from Twitter, together provide

improved explanatory power for diet compliance, compared
to the categories alone or their sub-combinations.

Further, we observe differences in the deviances (and the
corresponding χ2-statistics and log likelihoods) given by
the models predicting the different diet compliance met-
rics. The χ2-statistics for the three models predicting BASE-
LINE , CALDIFF:50 , and PROPDAYS:75 metrics tend to be
larger than the ones predicting CALDIFF , CALDIFF:25 , and
PROPDAYS:50 metrics. For instance, the model with the best
ﬁt, that uses language, activity and social measures in predict-
ing CALDIFF:50 has considerably low deviance compared
to the Null model; this difference follows a χ2 distribution:
χ2(53, N = 613) = 847.93 − 149.86 = 698.07, p < 10−4.

Measures with High Predictive Power. Next, we examine:
what measures provide the most explanatory power in pre-
dicting the different diet compliance metrics. For this pur-
pose, in Table 3, we report the β coefﬁcients given by the
logistic regression models predicting a subset of the diet com-
pliance metrics; we report on those models that use all of the
three categories of social media measures, language, activ-
ity, and social capital, and include the four models for which
we obtained the largest χ2-statistic values in Table 2. These
models are the ones that predict the following diet compli-
ance metrics: BASELINE , CALDIFF:25 , CALDIFF:50 , and
PROPDAYS:75 .

We now present a discussion of the measures with the highest
(absolute values) of the β coefﬁcients, that is, ones that depict
the most predictive association (positive or negative) with diet
compliance success/failure, across all of the models:

Observation 1: Users who succeed in diet compliance ex-
press higher positive affect; those who do not succeed ex-
press more negative affect, anger, anxiety, and sadness in
their Twitter posts. That is, likelihood of diet compliance
success is higher in users whose content exhibits a more pro-
nounced hedonic focus on positive emotions and a positive
outlook towards life (PA: β = 7.6 to 10.4).

“Train smart like a trainer. eat clean like a nutritionist. sleep
like well bathed baby. win like 6 time champion” (↑ positive
affect)

“Kids enjoying what they love best!
#enjoythemoment #festivalfun” (↑ positive affect)

festival fun! #blessed

Users who do not succeed express more negative emotions in
their posts (NA: β = −6.1 to −13.7), for instance, frustra-
tions in not being able to meet ﬁtness goals, or sharing less
pleasing experiences.

“I have had the shittest year, I have not done what I needed to
do and I have gained 30 pounds. how shit, how shit (↑ negative
affect)

“Silence is my go to when I’m upset, sad, mad or emotional.
It’s obvious something’s wrong cuz I’m nearly silent (↑ nega-
tive affect)

Users who fail in complying with their dietary goals also ex-
press higher levels of anxiety (anxiety: β = −2.4 to −6.3).
They tend to be anxious because of the lack of emotional con-
trol as well as due to certain activities and events of daily life.

Session: Tracking Activity & HealthCSCW 2017, February 25–March 1, 2017, Portland, OR, USA1340“I’m pretty sure I’m going to lose my mind. Completely lose
what little is left. I cry at the thought of stupid things..” (↑
anxiety)

“Feel rough as old boots this morning :/ Ankle hurts, shin hurts,
chest hurts, head hurts” (↑ anxiety)

Observation 2: Users who succeed in complying with their
diet plan exhibit high cognitive functioning and perception;
conversely, those who fail show signs of cognitive impair-
ment. Speciﬁcally, we observe that the former cohort speaks
more insightfully in their posts, shows a self-reﬂective shift
and connection to their own cognition through use of cogni-
tive mech (β = 5.1 to 8.4), inhibition (β = −2.1 to −3.1),
and insight words (β = 1.4 to 3.6).

“ If we never stumble we never fall. If we never fall we never
fail, and if we never fail we never grow! #noexcuses” (↑ cog-
nitive mech)

“ If you could ﬁnd something that would heal hurt, forgive
guilt, calm fear, inspire hope, reveal purpose, and give life
would that be good news?” (↑ cognitive mech)

Observation 3: Successful diet compliance users engage
in greater Twitter discourse around health issues and show
heightened interest in topics relating to body and physical
health. Speciﬁcally these health (β = 6.9 to 11.3) and body
(β = 4.8 to 6.4) related discourses include sharing tips to-
ward continuing to maintain ﬁtness progress, sharing advice
and information around improved eating habits and nutrition,
and disclosures of ﬁtness parameters like weight and body fat.

“Ever felt sick and tired of being sick and tired? I have been
exercising away chronic fatigue” (↑ health)

“Here are some awesome nutritional advice for health and
wellbeing ::URL:: #food #recipes #health #healthy” (↑ health)

“Week 1, down 7.2 lbs, 1” off the waist. chest, hips, neck :);
body fat remain unchanged. #letsdothis” (↑ body)

“When you wake up, stretch your arms, legs to get your blood
circulating in your body. this helps the body wake up faster”
(↑ body)

Observation 4: Users who are successful in diet compliance
express greater sense of achievement in their Twitter content.
We ﬁnd that these users engage in motivational and inspi-
rational content sharing around improved health and well-
being, as well as objective goals and outlook toward meeting
their desired ﬁtness and diet (achievement: β = 1.8 to 2.1).

“If your not failing your not trying hard enough. try, fail, try,
fail and repeat for success. #success” (↑ achievement)

“Just set behavior goals instead of outcome goals:instead of a
goal to lose 20 pounds, set a goal of strength training 3 days”
(↑ achievement)

Observation 5: Successful diet compliance users tend to
share content around family and friend relations, and topics
relating to their social life and events. Sharing of such con-
tent (family: β = 6.1 to 7.7; friends: β = 5.2 to 6.9; social:
β = 5.0 to 9.1) indicates the presence of a supportive social
structure for the successful users, ability to bond and engage
with it from time to time—aspects that are positively linked
to improved health and well-being [56].

“ Enjoying family. My uncle’s with their niece’s and nephews.
Minus a few nieces and nephews” (↑ family)

“Best friends since 5th grade; future best friends! blessed by
the wonderful life long friendships ::URL::” (↑ friends)

Observation 6: Users successful in complying with their diet
plans show a temporal orientation that focuses on the here
and now in their social media content, and demonstrate a fu-
ture temporal reference. This observation also suggests that
the successful users are goal-oriented and bear a positive out-
look towards the diet compliance process in the near future
(present tense: β = 2.3 to 4.6; future tense: β = 2.3 to 4.5).
Users who fail in complying with their dietary goals tend to
share posts that are ruminative of the past, and can be regret-
ful or nostalgic of past events.

“Transforming your body will have a domino effect. Your
body will change, your mind will change, your life will
change. Eric Eisenberg” (↑ future tense)

“ I will stick to my ﬁtness plan. It will be difﬁcult. It will take
time. It is going to require sacriﬁce. But it will be worth it.” (↑
future tense)

Observation 7: Users who succeed in complying with their
diet goals show higher collective attentional focus in their
social media writing (1st person plural pronouns), as well as
more social involvement and attention to people and objects,
manifested in the use of 2nd and 3rd person pronouns re-
spectively. Unsuccessful users, on the other hand, show high
pre-occupation with their own selves in their Twitter posts,
as measured through the use of 1st person singular pronouns
(1st pp. singular: β = −2.0 to −4.2).

Observation 8: Users successful in diet compliance tend to
be more socially interactive in their social media activity (as
measured by the sharing of @-replies), and tend to dissem-
inate more external information to their networks via links.
We conjecture this might indicate the desire for these users to
seek and reach out to others, as well as openness to consum-
ing and sharing novel information (interactivity: β = 4.2 to
9.6; information sharing: β = 3.7 to 5.5).

Observation 9: Finally, diet complying users exhibit greater
availability of social capital in their networks, as measured
by the number of inlinks and outlinks in their social media
network. Together, these measures (inlinks: β = 3.7 to 11.1;
outlinks: β = 4.9 to 7.1) indicate the presence of a strong
support system for users who succeed in their dietary goals.

Cross Validation and Performance Evaluation. Next, we
assess the performance of the six logistic regression models
that give the lowest deviances in Table 2, in predicting diet
compliance success/failures labels of users in a test set. Note
that these models use all of the language, activity and social
capital measures.

In Figure 4 we present the mean accuracy, precision, re-
call, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for
each model, averaged across the ﬁve folds of cross vali-
dation performed. Our best performing model is the one
that predicts success/failure for the CALDIFF:25 diet compli-
ance metric: the “chance” accuracy for this model is 53.8%,
and our model improves over it by 37.2%. Close second

Figure 4: Performance of different logistic regression models (accuracy, precision, recall, and receiver operating characteristic—
ROC curve) in classifying success and failure corresponding to the six different diet compliance metrics: BASELINE , CALDIFF
, CALDIFF:25 , CALDIFF:50 , PROPDAYS:50 , and PROPDAYS:75 .

are the models that predict diet compliance success/failure
for BASELINE , CALDIFF:25 , and PROPDAYS:75 , how-
ever their improvements over chance accuracies are modest:
1.4%, 3.1% and 7.7% respectively. We attribute this to the
large class imbalance in both the success/failure data for the
three diet compliance measures. Models corresponding to
CALDIFF and PROPDAYS:50 , that have a very high imbal-
ance class sizes (95.1% and 95.4% chance accuracies respec-
tively), yield 78.4% and 72.3% accuracy. These models thus
fail to improve over chance accuracy by 16.6% and 23.1%
respectively. Excluding them, our models that leverage Twit-
ter measures to predict diet compliance success and failure
improve over baseline chance models by 1.3–37.2%.

On average, all of our models produce satisfactory perfor-
mance in predicting diet compliance success/failure with
mean accuracy 84.4%, precision 77.3% and recall 86.7%.
From the ROC curve, we further observe that the models yield
large area under curve measures; that is, all of them produce
high true positive rates in predicting diet compliance, com-
promising a manageably small false positive rate.

RQ 2: Assessing Role of Social Media in Diet Compliance

Results of Auto-Regressive Models
Presenting the ﬁndings of RQ 2, we ﬁrst discuss the results
of ﬁtting two different VAR models toward forecasting each
diet compliance metric. Recall, our ﬁrst VAR model fore-
casts success (or failure) on day t based on (i) success/failure
in compliance over n previous days, as well as (ii) the num-
ber of calories consumed. The second VAR model forecasts
the same, but uses n lagged daily values of both previous suc-
cess/failure and calories consumed, along with all of the three
categories of social media derived measures (language, activ-
ity, social capital), aggregated per day. Since both of these
models use time series data, we needed to focus on users who
had sufﬁciently long durations of MFP entries as well as cor-
responding Twitter data. We consider all users who had at
least 100 days of MFP entries; if a user had more than two
weeks of gap between two consecutive MFP entries, we did
not include them in our analysis. Additionally, in order to
determine the optimal size of the lag parameter n in the two
VAR models, we consider historical (Twitter/MFP) measures
in increments of 10 days, from the day on which prediction is
sought: n = 10, 20, 30, ..., 90.

Next we tested whether our Twitter measure inclusive time
series predicts diet compliance success and failure. For the
purpose, we assessed the additional predictive capability of
Twitter data over MFP data, by employing ﬁve-fold cross val-
idation in each model, and then reporting accuracy in the test
sets. Figure 5 gives these performance measures for the two
auto-regressive models. We show one plot corresponding to
each diet compliance metric; in each plot we show the accu-
racy across different values of n. On an average, the Twitter
inclusive model improves accuracy by 17% compared to the
model that does not include this data.

Finally, for the VAR model that combines both MFP and
Twitter measures (Figure 5), we note that across the differ-
ent values of lag n (duration of historical data used in pre-
diction), log likelihood of the model is maximum, or corre-
spondingly, peak accuracy is observed at n = 41 days for all
of the diet compliance metrics. This also indicates that values
of n smaller than this may not encapsulate sufﬁcient informa-
tion for forecasting purposes, whereas when n is longer, the
historical data may include diet behaviors that have evolved
over time, and are thus less predictive.

Granger Causality Tests
As a last result, utilizing the optimal lag parameter n for the
individual metrics of diet compliance, we perform Granger
causality statistical tests. The tests examine the individual
role each of the MFP and Twitter measures play in forecasting
future diet compliance success and failure.

We begin by examining whether the pairs of time series we
consider for the Granger causality test: one corresponding to
diet compliance success or failure of a user, and the other cor-
responding to a particular linguistic, activity or social capital
measure, satisfy the Dickey Fuller tests for stationary time
series [19]. This is an important step to ensure the Granger
causality tests are applicable to the different pairs of time se-
ries we consider here. We ﬁnd that the pairs satisfy the Dickey
Fuller test (p < .05).

Following this test, in Table 4, we report the Wilks’ λ (like-
lihood ratio) statistic, Rao’s approximate F statistic, and the
p value of CCA between the two sets of time series, for each
pair of (MFP/Twitter based) predictor and predicted variables
(diet compliance success/failure) for all users. For a large

number of the Twitter derived predictor measures we con-
sider, there is statistical signiﬁcance in Granger causation.
This is indicated by lower values of the Wilks’ statistic and
higher values of the F -statistic. The measures include: affec-
tive attributes like PA, anger, anxiety and sadness; cognitive
attributes like cognitive mech, inhibition, certainty, as well as
perception words like see, hear, feel; temporal references like
past, present and future tense use; and interpersonal aware-
ness quantiﬁed by the use of 1st person singular and 2nd per-
son pronoun words.

All measures belonging to the activity and social capital cat-
egories also indicate high Granger signiﬁcance: interactivity,
number of inlinks, outlinks. While the MFP based predictor
variables, like past calorie consumed or proportion of suc-
cessful diet compliance days in the past, on their own, exhibit
signiﬁcant Granger causation, the signiﬁcance of the other
Twitter measures reveals the additional gain given by their
inclusion in the forecasting task. This, in turn, bolsters our
earlier observation about the utility of integrating social me-
dia with quantiﬁed self sensing data on diet compliance.

DISCUSSION

Theoretical and Practical Implications
Although our motivation and computational advances align
with the vision outlined by the PMI1, we note that, in the

scope of this paper, we did not include all possible forms
of sensed data such as genetics or biology, typically also in-
cluded in PMI’s agenda. Instead, we explored how two im-
portant elements of health related to each other: one’s physi-
ological attributes (diet compliance) and one’s behavioral at-
tributes (social media). We believe that the integration ap-
proach proposed in this paper will enable us to better un-
derstand the factors that affect the health of individuals as
measured in terms of their diet, the spatio-temporal trends
of physical ﬁtness as observed in quantiﬁed self sensing and
social media platforms integratively, or early signs that may
indicate a forthcoming risk to diet compliance. Our work can
also enable the development of novel interventions that can
proactively monitor risk to diet compliance, and bring appro-
priate clinical and psychosocial help to those in need. For ex-
ample, there is a growing body of work in the ﬁeld of clinical
nutrition to build models that can predict a patient’s weight
loss [45, 52, 22]. This research is motivated by the desire
“to make a decision about the beneﬁt, risk, or cost-efﬁcacy of
continued intervention” [22]. These predictive models take
into account both weight-speciﬁc variables, e.g., the starting
weight or the weight lost within an initial certain period, and
demographic factors, e.g., age and gender. Incorporating so-
cial media data, as shown in our work, could potentially im-
prove the predictive power of such interventions.

Additionally, consideration of two complementary sources of
data allows us to validate, for the ﬁrst time, the efﬁcacy of
social media and quantiﬁed self sensing measures in reveal-
ing risk to diet compliance. The Granger analysis method-
ology enables us to identify the additional gain in predictive
power made possible by examining social media data, over
approaches that use an individual’s historical diet compliance
data alone. In the future, our technique may also be improved,
such as with stratiﬁcation or propensity score matching [18],
to delineate causal pathways associated with diet compliance
by aligning multi-level, multi-modal, comprehensive assess-
ments as gleaned from social media and quantiﬁed self sens-
ing together. For instance, by temporally aligning social me-
dia, quantiﬁed self sensing and self-reported attributes, sta-
tistical models may be able to explore dynamics of events
around when or how soon an individual is likely to fail in
meeting their dietary goal.

Implications for Design
Integration of diverse health data can lay groundwork for the
design of appropriate, adaptive, and privacy-honoring health
interventions that may be delivered via a variety of channels:
social media, or mobile phone applications. Such tools could
be personalized using the quantiﬁed self and social media
data collected on each individual. They can also “machine
learn” patterns over time as more data becomes available. We
describe design considerations of some such tools below:

Persuasion Strategies. First, social media technologies can
apply a variety of automated or semi-automated persuasion
strategies that are typically used by people to inﬂuence others
towards positive behavior change goals—positive feedback,
modeling target behaviors or attitudes, and inﬂuencing nor-
mative rules and social dynamics [13]. Should our methods

discover someone to be at risk of diet compliance failure in
the future, motivational messages could be issued as pop-ups
in one’s MFP application or social media.

Gamiﬁcation is also possible wherein daily diet compliance
success/failure can translate to conﬁdence boosting concrete
metrics like rewards, points or badges [59]. Our ability to
estimate risk of failure can enable timely and tailored deploy-
ment of gamiﬁcation approaches. For instance, on forecasting
that an individual may be at risk of diet compliance failure,
subtle nudges (e.g., access to help resources) and alerts could
be provided such that individuals can make plans or arrange-
ments that can help them accrue speciﬁc incentives or rewards
in the future.

Social Support. Additionally, mechanisms could be created
on social media platforms to provide socially supportive in-
terventions to individuals at risk of diet compliance failure
(e.g., those expressing high NA or high cognitive impairment
in their Twitter posts). Such interventions could suggest them
to engage with users observed to be successful at diet com-
pliance, for instance, through recommendations surfaced on
one’s social media or quantiﬁed self sensing application.
Individuals can thus explore and learn about what to expect
while trying to meet speciﬁc dietary goals, tips and tricks on
how to combat urges or situations that make them vulnerable
to failure, or for general positive reinforcement to meet their
desired dietary goal. Alternatively, at-risk users identiﬁed by
our methods, such as those who exhibit lower access to social
capital, could be recommended to bond as a virtual commu-
nity based on hashtags or speciﬁc social media accounts. This
can allow individuals provide peer support to each other, cal-
ibrate and compare their own diet compliance success/failure
trend with that of others, and motivate each other in helping
meet dietary goals.

Self-Reﬂection. While quantiﬁed self sensing applications
like MFP are great at allowing individuals to log their diet
and desired goals [12], our methods could be used to en-
hance their abilities in promoting improved diet compliance.
Trends of diet compliance success/failure may be provided to
users of such applications, including forecasts of their like-
lihood to succeed. Social, activity and other linguistic at-
tributes obtained from social media that relate to these fore-
casts could also be overlaid with the trends, so that indi-
viduals can explore these relationships in an intuitive man-
ner. Broadly, these tools hold the potential to enable better
self-reﬂection and self-awareness of one’s dietary practices,
so that they could adapt appropriately to forecasted changes
in diet compliance. Forecasting abilities can also help self-
experimentation. For instance, if an individual ﬁnds out they
are unlikely to meet their current dietary goals, they could
employ changes in their day-to-day activities or alter speciﬁc
strategies currently in use.

Certainly, designing and deploying the right kind of interven-
tions that fall in any of the above groups needs to carefully
consider an individual’s choices, lifestyle, and context. These
are active directions of future research. What we describe
here is the potential of our methods in informing some of

the decisions that underlie next generation personalized and
adaptive intervention tools.

Privacy and Ethical Considerations
Integration of multiple forms of data to promote positive
health behaviors is promising, but such approaches are par-
ticularly vulnerable to privacy and ethical lapses. We note
that individuals may be unaware of the implications of shar-
ing content on social media or of the data being collected via
quantiﬁed self sensing technologies. Importantly, they might
be ignorant of the latent relationships that may be discovered
by integrating these diverse forms of health, social, linguistic
and activity data, as enabled by our approach. Even though a
lot of the health inferences found in prior research are derived
from implicit patterns in activity on social media [31], the
ability to automatically derive any information about a per-
son’s health state may have serious repercussions (e.g., higher
insurance rates). Developing tools that remind users of these
risks through interactive ways of interpreting their own data,
is an important area of future exploration.

Nevertheless, introducing transparency of data analysis to in-
dividuals can be challenging. This is because many machine
learning approaches typically applied for health inference,
like the ones we developed in this paper, consist of non-
intuitive, and complex workﬂows. Promoting actual under-
standing of such systems and their methods to a non-expert
would require developing methods that can abstract opera-
tional details but at the same time allow intuitive characteri-
zation. Importantly, to promote transparency and still be able
to tackle the challenges it poses, novel intervention systems
need to revisit the regulations around access, precision and
adaptive rights of those individuals who are algorithmically
inferred to be at heightened risk of a certain health challenge.

Limitations and Future Directions

Truthfulness of MFP data. We note that it is challenging
to accurately estimate how diligent MFP users are in logging
their meals. Cordeiro et al. [14] present a qualitative study
based on surveys and online forums that analyzes the difﬁ-
culties faced by users of food journals. Further, a previous
analysis of MFP food diaries [57] found that, just before stop-
ping to use the food logging capability in MFP, users would
log fewer and fewer calories. Though this could be a positive
sign of success, more likely it indicates a drop in “logging
morale”. However, the same study also found evidence that
users prefer to not log at all rather than enter incomplete data.
Concretely, users were least likely to log anything on Sat-
urdays and Sundays but, those users that did, had the high-
est probability across all week days to be above their calorie
goal. So whereas some users might not log their caloric in-
take on a “cheat day” at all, those who do, publicly admit to
fail in their goal for these days. This gives us conﬁdence that,
except for potential “end of user lifetime” effects, long-term
users can largely be assumed to truthfully report their meals,
if they choose to report at all.

Still, as we cannot be sure of the food consumed by the
users in our study, our ﬁndings ultimately only apply to self-
reported diet compliance, rather than the (unobservable) ac-

Session: Tracking Activity & HealthCSCW 2017, February 25–March 1, 2017, Portland, OR, USA1344tual diet compliance. In the future, technical solutions aimed
at facilitating and automating food logging might overcome
this limitation [60].

Choice of diet compliance measures. Recall, we considered
six different measures of diet compliance in this paper. These
measures are not meant to be the only possible ways to assess
diet compliance. By the same token, we do not suggest em-
ploying these speciﬁc measures in the interventions we pro-
pose above. Instead, the choice of the diet compliance mea-
sures was meant to enable comprehensive assessment of the
role of social media data in improving predictions of health
behavior, albeit a speciﬁc one relating to diet.

In fact, having demonstrated the role of social media, appro-
priately chosen diet compliance measures may be used in spe-
ciﬁc application contexts. We tested this claim by choosing
two intuitive and simple alternative diet compliance metrics
and re-running the analysis in RQ 1: 1) the difference be-
tween calorie goal and consumption of an individual; and 2)
the proportion of days an individual’s calorie consumption
is less than their goal. We built and evaluated two OLS re-
gression models to examine if social media can be adequate
in predicting these two diet compliance measures. We found
satisfactory performance for both, with R2 values .24 and .13
respectively (p < .05). This indicates that social media in-
formation is valuable in not just classifying diet compliance
success and failure in individuals deﬁned by our six measures,
but can also help predict the extent of one’s success or failure
in contexts that use alternative diet compliance measures.

Bias toward diet compliance success. Relatedly, for the set
of six diet compliance measures we considered in this paper,
our MFP data appears to be inherently biased toward those
who ﬁnally succeed (see Table 1). This is evident in the no-
table class imbalance observed for BASELINE , CALDIFF ,
and PROPDAYS:50 . But this is not surprising: the quanti-
ﬁed selfers who use an application like MFP are inherently
more motivated to watch their calories, than those who do not
use these technologies. Therefore, in building our predictive
models, we evaluated performance of our models over what
can be given by a simple chance model that labels everyone
in the test set to succeed. Nevertheless, it is possible for the
chosen success measures to be correlated with the predictors;
and therefore we suggest caution in interpreting our ﬁndings.

Representativeness of Twitter data. Concerning the use of
public Twitter posts, there are also a number of limitations to
consider, in addition to the privacy and ethical considerations
discussed above. These issues include self-selection bias con-
cerning individuals who choose to share MFP diary updates
on Twitter, and self-censorship and impression management
related issues. This includes conscious decisions to ﬁlter and
to not post speciﬁc bits of information that may portray one’s
less pleasant health or diet related experiences.

Although the individuals who share MFP updates on Twitter
might not be similar to Twitter users who use MFP without
sharing that information on the social media platform, we do
observe the users in our dataset to use Twitter for reasons be-
yond health information sharing—many of them had Twitter

accounts that date prior to the start of MFP logging. Never-
theless, our methods can easily be extended to contexts where
diet compliance information is collected via a survey or an-
other self-report based method.

We also suspect the inﬂuence of self-censorship on our ﬁnd-
ings to be minimal. This is because the capability of sharing
MFP updates on Twitter are typically set up during installa-
tion of the MFP application. Thus while theoretically possi-
ble, it is practically less likely that individuals would regu-
larly curate their Twitter posting behaviors, per the informa-
tion shared by the MFP application at a given point in time.

Generalizability of temporal predictions. Apart from data
quality concerns, we also note the limitations of our temporal
prediction task based on Granger causality analysis. Recall,
we utilized individuals who had at least 100 days of MFP
log data, and well as Twitter data spanning the same period.
This ﬁltering was important to ensure that we have sufﬁcient
length of temporal data available to train and test our mod-
els, since smaller timeframes if considered, can greatly ag-
gravate the inﬂuence of noise. However we also note that,
many quantiﬁed self applications have high abandonment
rates [10]. Estimates of 30-day install retention rates for
health and ﬁtness apps range from 40%7 to 75%8. Interest-
ingly, of those users who do use the app beyond the ﬁrst day,
more than half continue to use it for at least 30 days.

Hence we acknowledge that our ﬁndings do not generalize to
those users who had quit using MFP sooner than 100 days,
or those who did not have Twitter data matching the pe-
riod of MFP data. Such missing data is a known limitation
of traditional supervised learning, and can be addressed by
employing methods like the survival analysis that take into
account “censoring” of missing data. Nevertheless, our ap-
proach and ﬁndings provide insights into the ability to predict
these individual-level trends of diet compliance by combining
quantiﬁed self sensing data with social media data.

Peer effects. Further, we do not analyze social inﬂuence
effects on general health and well-being, or more speciﬁ-
cally on diet compliance. Prior work indicates a signiﬁcant
link between one’s own health and friends with similar at-
tributes [46]. We believe many of these effects are captured
via one’s posting behavior and social network structural at-
tributes we considered here. However it is possible that there
are latent peer effect variables, e.g., feedback from speciﬁc
contacts, or the accrued social status in one’s network, that
were not accounted for in our models. An interesting future
direction could examine these inﬂuence effects more thor-
oughly, perhaps by collecting data for clustered communities
of individuals who use social media and who are attempting
to succeed in their dietary goals over time.

Causality. We suggest caution in inferring causality from
our ﬁndings. Although Granger causality is widely adopted
in econometrics to obtain causal links between two different

sions regarding causality in our speciﬁc setting of forecast-
ing an individual’s future diet compliance success or failure.
While it is possible that experiences and events on social me-
dia can trigger one’s success or failure, there could be many
latent factors, not observable via either MFP or Twitter data,
that might inﬂuence these outcomes. Future work could ex-
pand the types of data that could be linked to diet compliance
as a way to account for as many potential ways to capture
these latent factors.

Intent. Finally, while we do demonstrate that valuable sig-
nals may be gleaned from social media to forecast diet com-
pliance success or failure, as with any quantitative method,
our ﬁndings do not explain why these signals are useful. Nei-
ther do they provide insights into the motivations and intent
of individuals who choose to share diet and health related in-
formation on a public social media platform or why they had
chosen the speciﬁc dietary goal, though some prior qualita-
tive work provides helpful insights [51]. These are questions
that are ripe to be investigated in the future through mixed
methods approaches.

CONCLUSION
Previous work had shown the promise that both quantiﬁed
self tools and social media hold for modeling an individ-
ual’s health. However, quantiﬁed self data and social media
data have largely been studied in isolation. In this paper, we
demonstrated the relationship that exists between the two, us-
ing public data from the MyFitnessPal application and Twit-
ter. We used MyFitnessPal food diaries to evaluate an indi-
vidual’s adherence to their self-deﬁned calorie goals. We then
linked this information to a number of linguistic, activity, and
social capital features derived from their Twitter feed. In do-
ing so, we showed that (i) there are behavioral measures de-
rived from social media that are predictive of diet compliance
success of individuals (RQ 1), and that (ii) social media de-
rived measures can be integrated with sensed historical data
about diet to better predict future diet compliance (RQ 2).
Looking into the factors linked to diet compliance success,
we observed that more successful users: (i) express higher
positive affect and a greater sense of achievement, (ii) exhibit
high cognitive functioning and perception and a stronger fu-
ture orientation, and (iii) are generally more social, both in
terms of topics discussed, interaction patterns and in terms of
the size of their social network.

We hope that our work contributes to achieving a more holis-
tic view of an individual’s health, including general behav-
ioral and lifestyle information from social media and self-
logged physiological data, going beyond what is recorded in
traditional health records.

Table 4: Results of multivariate Granger causality tests for different MFP and Twitter measures in forecasting future diet com-
pliance success/failure. For each measure, we report the Wilks’ λ (likelihood ratio) statistic, Rao’s approximate F statistic, and
the p value (-: p = .05; *: p = .01; **: p = .001; and ***: p = .0001). Results are shown for all six diet compliance metrics.
Grey rows indicate measures for which none of the diet compliance predictions yielded Granger signiﬁcance at p = .0001 level.
