CPF 4-2023-031-NOPV 

Dear Mr. Hampton: 

From  May  16  to  June  24,  2022,  representatives  of  the  Pipeline  and  Hazardous  Materials  Safety 
Administration (PHMSA), pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 United States Code (U.S.C.), inspected 
Valero  Terminaling  and  Distribution  Company’s  (Valero) transmission pipeline system  in  Alsip, 
Illinois and Hammond, Indiana. 

As  a  result  of  the  inspection,  it  is  alleged  that  Valero  has  committed  probable  violations  of  the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.).  The items inspected 
and the probable violations are: 

1. 

§ 195.505 Qualification program. 

Each  operator  shall  have  and  follow  a  written  qualification 

program. The program shall include provisions to: 

(a) . . . . 
(i)  After  December  16,  2004,  notify  the  Administrator  or  a  state 
agency  participating  under  49  U.S.C.  Chapter  601  if  the  operator 
significantly modifies the program after the administrator or state 

 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
agency has verified that it complies with this section. Notifications 
to  PHMSA  may  be 
to 
submitted  by 
InformationResourcesManager@dot.gov,  or  by  mail  to  ATTN: 
Information  Resources  Manager  DOT/PHMSA/OPS,  East  Building, 
2nd Floor, E22-321, New Jersey Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20590. 

electronic  mail 

Valero failed follow its written qualification program in accordance with § 195.505.  Specifically, 
Valero failed to notify the Texas Railroad Commission (TRRC) of significant modifications of its 
Operator Qualification Program (OQ Program) in 2021 in accordance with § 195.505 and section 
2.7.2 of its Operator Qualification (OQ) Program. 

Valero  significantly  modified  its  OQ  program  July  2021  and  notified  PHMSA,  the  Louisiana 
Department of Natural Resources, the California Office of the State Fire Marshall, and the Oklahoma 
Corporation Commission.  However, Valero failed to notify the TRRC. 

Therefore, Valero failed follow its written qualification program in accordance with § 195.505. 

2. 

§ 195.573 What must I do to monitor external corrosion control? 

(a) . . . . 
(d)  Breakout  tanks.  You  must  inspect  each  cathodic  protection 
system  used  to  control  corrosion  on  the  bottom  of  an  aboveground 
breakout tank to ensure that operation and maintenance of the system 
are in accordance with API RP 651 (incorporated by reference, see § 
195.3).  However,  this  inspection  is  not  required  if  you  note  in  the 
corrosion  control  procedures  established  under  §  195.402(c)(3)  why 
complying with all or certain operation and maintenance provisions of 
API RP 651 is not necessary for the safety of the tank. 

Valero failed to inspect each cathodic protection system used to control corrosion on the bottom of 
an  aboveground  breakout  tank  in  accordance  with  §  195.573(d).  Specifically,  Valero  failed  to 
inspect the cathodic protection system on the bottom of aboveground breakout tank #1 at Hammond 
terminal  for  calendar  years  2019  and  2021.  Valero  inspected  the  cathodic  protection  system  on 
breakout tank #1 on May 14, 2020, and many of the cathodic protection readings were below criteria. 

Therefore, Valero failed to inspect each cathodic protection system used to control corrosion on the 
bottom of an aboveground breakout tank in accordance with § 195.573(d). 

3. 

§ 195.583 What must I do to monitor atmospheric corrosion control? 

(a)  You  must  inspect  each  pipeline  or  portion  of  pipeline  that  is 
exposed  to  the  atmosphere  for  evidence  of  atmospheric  corrosion,  as 
follows: 

If the pipeline is 
located: 

Onshore 

Then the frequency of inspection is: 

At  least  once  every  3  calendar  years,  but  with 
exceeding 39 months.

Offshore 

At least once each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 
15 months. 

Valero failed to inspect each pipeline or portion of pipeline that is exposed to the atmosphere for 
evidence of atmospheric corrosion at least once every three calendar years, but with intervals not 
exceeding 39 months, in accordance with § 195.583(a).  Specifically, for the East Chicago 12-inch 
pipeline,  Hammond  8-inch  pipeline,  and  6-inch  Natural  Gasoline  pipeline,  Valero  conducted 
atmospheric corrosion inspections at a 41-month interval. 

Therefore,  Valero  failed  to  inspect  each  pipeline  or  portion  of  pipeline  that  is  exposed  to  the 
atmosphere for evidence of atmospheric corrosion at least once every three calendar years, but with 
intervals not exceeding 39 months, in accordance with § 195.583(a).

maximum of $2,251,334 for a related series of violations.  For violations occurring on or after January 
11, 2021, and before May 3, 2021, the maximum penalty may not exceed $222,504 per violation per

PROPOSED COMPLIANCE ORDER 

Pursuant  to  49  U.S.C.  §  60118,  the  Pipeline  and  Hazardous  Materials  Safety  Administration 
(PHMSA)  proposes  to  issue  to  Valero  Terminaling  and  Distribution  Company  (Valero)  a 
Compliance Order incorporating the following remedial requirements to ensure the compliance of 
Valero with the pipeline safety regulations: 

A. 

Regarding Item 2 of the Notice pertaining to Valero’s failure to inspect the cathodic 
protection  system  used  to  control  corrosion  on  the  bottom  of  its  above-ground 
breakout tank #1 at Hammond terminal, Valero must inspect the cathodic protection 
system for breakout tank #1 at the Hammond terminal and submit the test inspection 
report to Director, Southwest Region within 30 days of the issuance of the Final 
Order. 

It is requested (not mandated) that Valero maintain documentation of the safety improvement costs 
associated with fulfilling this Compliance Order and submit the total to Bryan Lethcoe, Director, 
Southwest  Region,  Pipeline  and  Hazardous  Materials  Safety  Administration.  It  is  requested  that 
these costs be reported in two categories: 1) total cost associated with preparation/revision of plans, 
procedures, studies and analyses, and 2) total cost associated with replacements, additions and other 
changes to pipeline infrastructure.
