Mr. Steve Kean 
Chief Executive Officer 
Kinder Morgan Liquid Terminals, LLC 
1001 Louisiana Street, Suite 1000 
Houston, Texas 77002 

Dear Mr. Kean: 

CPF 1-2023-036-NOPV 

From June 13, 2022 through November 4, 2022, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous 
Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), pursuant to Chapter 
601  of  49  United  States  Code  (U.S.C.)  conducted  an  integrated  inspection  of  Kinder  Morgan 
Liquid Terminals, LLC’s (KMLT) pipeline facilities in Carteret and Perth Amboy, New Jersey. 

As  a  result  of  the  inspection,  it  is  alleged  that  you  have  committed  probable  violations  of  the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The items inspected 
and the probable violations are: 

1. 

§  195.264  Impoundment,  protection  against  entry,  normal/emergency  venting  or 
pressure/vacuum relief for aboveground breakout tanks. 

(a) … 
(b)  After  October  2,  2000,  compliance  with  paragraph  (a)  of  this 
section  requires  the  following  for  the  aboveground  breakout  tanks 
specified: 

(1) For tanks built to API Spec 12F, API Std 620, and others (such 
as API Std 650 (or its predecessor Standard 12C)), the installation of 
impoundment  must  be  in  accordance  with  the  following  sections  of 
NFPA-30 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3); 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(i)  Impoundment  around  a  breakout  tank  must  be  installed  in 

accordance with section 22.11.2; and 

(ii) Impoundment by drainage to a remote impounding area must 

be installed in accordance with section 22.11.1. 

KMLT failed to provide adequate records for its Carteret and Perth Amboy, New Jersey facility 
breakout tanks built post October 2, 2000, demonstrating adequate impoundments in accordance 
with NFPA-30 and § 195.264(b)(1).1 

During  the  inspection,  PHMSA  requested  records  for  the  Perth  Amboy  and  Carteret  facilities 
related to breakout tanks going into service after 10/02/00 demonstrating they have an adequate 
impoundment.  KMLT provided the Perth Amboy PHMSA Breakout Tank Form and the Carteret 
PHMSA Breakout Tank Form, dated 2022 (BOT Form).  The BOT Form indicated there are 26 
breakout tanks at Carteret and 9 breakout tanks at Perth Amboy that are built in accordance with 
API  650,  post-10/02/00.  PHMSA  requested  records  demonstrating  these  breakout  tanks  had 
adequate  tank  impoundment  calculations.  KMLT  provided  the  following  (Tank  Impoundment 
Records): 

•  Carteret Volosin Associates, LLC Report, dated 2014-2019 
•  Carteret Volosin Associates, LLC Report, dated 09/30/13 
•  Aboveground  Storage  Tank  Secondary  Containment  Construction  and  Capacities-

Carteret, dated 10/22 

•  Main Facility Area Containment Summary, dated 03/17/14 
•  Perth Amboy Tank 27 Dike Containment, dated 02/26/20 
•  SPCC Section 8.0 – Secondary Containment, dated 01/22 
•  Table 1- Aboveground Storage Tanks, dated 01/22 

During the inspection, PHMSA requested where the tank impoundment records were located and 
what  documentation  supported  the  calculations  on  the  various  documents.  KMLT  stated  its 
Aboveground Storage Tank Secondary Containment Construction and Capacities- Carteret, dated 
10/22 and its Table 1- Aboveground Storage Tanks, dated 01/22 contained this data, and that the 
Volosin Reports document the calculations.  The Tank Impoundment Records, however, had many 
discrepancies  such  as  incorrectly  referenced  breakout  tank  numbers,  incorrect  dike  area 
containment and tank volumes, dike areas incorrectly labeled as well as unsupported calculations. 
PHMSA asked how this information is recorded properly and where it is documented. KMLT’s 
breakout tank subject matter expert discussed how the data does not align properly, the calculations 
are incorrect, and they are unaware which document contains the updated and correct information. 

1 Section 195.264(b)(1) currently cites the incorporated by reference (IBR) tank impoundment requirements in 
Sections 22.11.1 and 22.11.2 of the 2012 edition of NFPA-30.  See § 195.3.  Previous iterations of § 195.264(b)(1) 
cited other sections of NFPA-30, because the relevant tank impoundment requirements in that IBR have been re-
numbered and updated over time (e.g., the 1999 final rule (64 Fed. Reg. 15,935 (Apr. 2, 1999)) adopting § 
195.264(b)(1) cited the tank impoundment requirements in Sections  2–3.4.2 and  2–3.4.3 of the 1996 edition of 
NFPA-30).  The allegations here regarding the lack of demonstration of adequate impoundment involves IBR tank 
impoundment calculation requirements that are consistent across the editions of NFPA-30 that have been cited in § 
195.264(b)(1). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subsequent to the inspection via email correspondence, KMLT-PHMSA Email Correspondence, 
dated  01/19/2023  (Email  Record)  KMLT  discussed  its  plans  to  update  its  records,  including 
performing aerial fly-over surveys to gather data for updating the dike volume calculations. 

Therefore,  KMLT  failed  to  provide  adequate  records  demonstrating  that  its  Carteret  and  Perth 
Amboy,  New  Jersey  facility  breakout  tanks  built  post  October  2,  2000  have  adequate 
impoundments in accordance with NFPA-30 and § 195.264(b)(1).

§ 195.402 Procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies. 

(a)  General.  Each  operator  shall  prepare  and  follow  for  each 
pipeline system a manual of written procedures for conducting normal 
operations  and  maintenance  activities  and  handling  abnormal 
operations and emergencies. This manual shall be reviewed at intervals 
not  exceeding  15  months,  but  at  least  once  each  calendar  year,  and 
appropriate  changes  made  as  necessary  to  insure  that  the  manual  is 
effective. This manual shall be prepared before initial operations of a 
pipeline  system  commence,  and  appropriate  parts  shall  be  kept  at 
locations where operations and maintenance activities are conducted. 

KMLT failed to follow its manual of written procedures.  Specifically, KMLT failed to follow its 
T-O&M  500 – Pump Emergency  Shutdown, dated  09/14/16  and  12/10/20 (ESD Procedure)  for 
conducting its emergency shutdown tests, in accordance with § 195.402(a). 

Section 3.5 of the ESD Procedure requires, in part, that KMLT must operate its ESD system at 
least once per calendar year (but not exceeding 15 months) to verify that the system works.  Such 
operation must also be documented. 

During the inspection, PHMSA requested records related to emergency shutdown test for calendar 
years 2020 and 2021 across its three facilities – Carteret, Carteret Truck Rack and Perth Amboy. 
KMLT  provided  its,  Emergency  Shutdown  Test- Carteret,  dated  09/11/20  and  Emergency 
Shutdown  Test- Perth  Amboy,  dated  03/30/20  (ESD  Records).  KMLT  failed  to  provide  the 
following  records:  2020 ESD  Record  for  Carteret  Truck  Rack,  2021  ESD Record  for  Carteret, 
2021 ESD Record for Perth Amboy and 2021 ESD Record for Carteret Truck Rack.  Subsequent 
to  the  inspection,  PHMSA  re-requested  the  2020  and  2021  records.  KMLT  stated  via  email 
correspondence on December 2, 2022 that they have shared all of the records that are available 
and that no additional records for 2020 or 2021 were available. 

Therefore, KMLT failed to follow its manual of written procedures for conducting its emergency 
shutdown tests for calendar years 2020 and 2021, in accordance with § 195.402(a). 

3. 

§ 195.402 Procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies. 

(a)  General.  Each  operator  shall  prepare  and  follow  for  each 
pipeline system a manual of written procedures for conducting normal 
operations  and  maintenance  activities  and  handling  abnormal 
operations and emergencies. This manual shall be reviewed at intervals 
not  exceeding  15  months,  but  at  least  once  each  calendar  year,  and 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
appropriate  changes  made  as  necessary  to  insure  that  the  manual  is 
effective. This manual shall be prepared before initial operations of a 
pipeline  system  commence,  and  appropriate  parts  shall  be  kept  at 
locations where operations and maintenance activities are conducted. 

KMLT failed to follow its manual of written procedures.  Specifically, KMLT failed to follow its 
Integrity  Management  Program  –  IMPM,  dated  10/05/22  (IMPM)  for  conducting  its  integrity 
management program effectiveness reviews, in accordance with § 195.402(a). 

Section 10.3.1 of the IMPM requires, in part, the collection of integrity performance measures in 
an annual integrity management program presentation and review conducted by the integrity team 
and director. Section 10.3.1 indicates this annual review is to evaluate and track the effectiveness 
of the IMPM. 

During the inspection, PHMSA requested records related to measuring its integrity management 
program effectiveness for the annual IMP presentation for calendar years 2019 and 2020.  KMLT 
provided its Annual IMP Performance Review, dated 05/13/20 and its Annual IMP Performance 
Review, dated 10/26/22 (IMP Annual Records).  KMLT discussed how the annual review covered 
the performance metrics for the year prior (in this case for 2019 and 2021).  When PHMSA re-
requested  the  2020  calendar  year  records,  KMLT  did  not  have  a  response.  Subsequent  to  the 
inspection, PHMSA re-requested the 2020 records and KMLT stated the 2019 and the 2021 records 
were uploaded to external SharePoint site. 

Therefore,  KMLT  failed  to  follow  its  manual  of  written  procedures  for  conducting  its  annual 
integrity management effectiveness presentation review for calendar year 2020, in accordance with 
§ 195.402(a). 

4. 

§ 195.402 Procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies. 

(a)  General.  Each  operator  shall  prepare  and  follow  for  each 
pipeline system a manual of written procedures for conducting normal 
operations  and  maintenance  activities  and  handling  abnormal 
operations and emergencies. This manual shall be reviewed at intervals 
not  exceeding  15  months,  but  at  least  once  each  calendar  year,  and 
appropriate  changes  made  as  necessary  to  insure  that  the  manual  is 
effective. This manual shall be prepared before initial operations of a 
pipeline  system  commence,  and  appropriate  parts  shall  be  kept  at 
locations where operations and maintenance activities are conducted. 

KMLT failed to conduct its 2020 calendar year annual review of its  emergency manual for the 
Perth Amboy, New Jersey facility at the required interval in accordance with § 195.402(a).  

During  the  inspection,  PHMSA  requested  the  annual  review  records  for  KMLT’s  emergency 
manuals for calendar years 2019 and 2020.  KMLT provided the Annual Procedure Review Record 
–  Perth  Amboy  Terminal,  dated  05/08/19  and  09/16/20  (Annual  ERP  Review).  The  interval 
between the 2019 and 2020 calendar year Annual ERP Review exceeded the permitted 15-month 
interval.  When  PHMSA  inquired  further  about  the  emergency  manual  annual  review  being
