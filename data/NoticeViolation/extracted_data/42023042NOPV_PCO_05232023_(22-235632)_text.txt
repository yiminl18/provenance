NOTICE OF PROBABLE VIOLATION 
and 
PROPOSED COMPLIANCE ORDER 

VIA ELECTRONIC MAIL

Senior Vice President Operations 
Enable Mississippi River Transmission LLC

Houston, TX 77002 

Dear Mr. Amundsen: 

CPF 4-2023-042-NOPV 

From April 4 through November 2, 2022, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 
Safety  Administration  (PHMSA)  pursuant  to  Chapter  601  of  49  United  States  Code  (U.S.C.) 
inspected Enable Mississippi River Transmission LLC’s (Enable) natural gas pipeline systems in 
Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas. 

As a result of the  inspection, it  is  alleged  that you have  committed  a  probable  violation  of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The item inspected and 
the probable violation is: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. 

§ 191.23 Reporting safety-related conditions. 

(a)  Except  as  provided  in  paragraph  (b)  of  this  section,  each 
operator shall report in accordance with § 191.25 the existence of any 
of the following safety-related conditions involving facilities in service: 

(1) . . . . 
(9)  Any  safety-related  condition  that  could  lead  to  an  imminent 
hazard and causes (either directly or indirectly by remedial action of 
the operator), for purposes other than abandonment, a 20% or more 
reduction in operating pressure or shutdown of operation of a pipeline, 
UNGSF, or an LNG facility that contains or processes gas or LNG. 

Enable failed to file a report in accordance with § 191.25 for a safety-related condition (SRC) that 
caused (either directly or indirectly by remedial action of the operator), for purposes other than 
abandonment,  a  20%  or  more  reduction  in  operating  pressure  as  required  by  §  191.23(a)(9). 
Specifically, Enable failed to file an SRC report within five working days after it reduced pressure 
on the Black River Pipeline by 20%. 

On July 6, 2021, Enable received a preliminary Magnetic Flux Leakage Axial (MFL-A) report for 
the Black River Pipeline.  The report indicated there was a 79% metal wall loss anomaly within 
220 yards of a dwelling.  On July 8, 2021, Enable reduced the operating pressure by 20%, from 
619  psig  to  495  psig,  in  response  to  the  SRC.  On  July  23,  2021,  Enable  conducted  in-situ 
Ultrasonic  Testing  and  discovered  an  additional  anomaly  that  showed  96%  metal  wall  loss 
anomaly.  In response to this anomaly, the Enable further reduced the operating pressure to 95 psig 
on the same day. 

However, Enable failed to file an SRC report within five working days after it reduced operating 
pressure on the Black River Pipeline by 20%.  Enable notified PHMSA of the SRC on August 2, 
2021, almost one month after reducing the pressure by 20% due to an SRC. 

Therefore, Enable failed to file a report in accordance with § 191.25 for an SRC that caused (either 
directly or indirectly by remedial action of the operator), for purposes other than abandonment, a 
20% or more reduction in operating pressure as required by § 191.23(a)(9). 

Proposed Compliance Order 

Under 49 U.S.C. § 60122 and 49 CFR § 190.223, you are subject to a civil penalty not to exceed 
$257,664 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,576,627 for a related 
series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after March 21, 2022 and before January 6, 
2023, the maximum penalty may not exceed $239,142 per violation per day the violation persists, 
up to a maximum of $2,391,412 for a related series of violations.  For violation occurring on or 
after May 3, 2021 and before March 21, 2022, the maximum penalty may not exceed $225,134 
per violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,251,334 for a related series of 
violations.  For  violation  occurring  on  or  after  January  11,  2021  and  before  May  3,  2021,  the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
maximum penalty may not exceed $222,504 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a 
maximum of $2,225,034 for a related series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after July 
31,  2019  and  before  January  11,  2021,  the  maximum  penalty  may  not  exceed  $218,647  per 
violation  per  day the  violation  persists,  up to  a  maximum  of  $2,186,465  for  a related  series  of 
violations.  For violation occurring on or after November 27, 2018 and before July 31, 2019, the 
maximum penalty may not exceed $213,268 per violation per day, with a maximum penalty not to 
exceed $2,132,679.  For violation occurring on or after November 2, 2015 and before November 
27, 2018, the maximum penalty may not exceed $209,002 per violation per day, with a maximum 
penalty not to exceed $2,090,022. 

We have reviewed the circumstances and supporting documents involved in this case, and have 
decided not to propose a civil penalty assessment at this time. 

With respect to Item 1 pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 60118, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety 
Administration proposes to issue a Compliance Order to Enable Gas Transmission LLC.  Please

PROPOSED COMPLIANCE ORDER 

Pursuant  to  49  United  States  Code  §  60118,  the  Pipeline  and  Hazardous  Materials  Safety 
Administration (PHMSA) proposes to issue to Enable Gas Transmission LLC a Compliance Order 
incorporating  the  following  remedial  requirements  to  ensure  the  compliance  of  Enable  Gas 
Transmission LLC with the pipeline safety regulations: 

A. 

B. 

In regard to 1 of the Notice pertaining to Enable’s failure to file a safety-related 
condition report in the required time, Enable must submit records indicating that 
personnel  responsible  for  submitting  safety-related  condition  reports  have  been 
trained on the reporting requirements within 90 days of issuance of the Final Order. 

It 
is  requested  (not  mandated)  that  Enable  Gas  Transmission  LLC  maintain
