Richard Prior 
President, Liquids Pipelines 
TC Oil Pipeline Operations, Inc. 
700 Louisiana Street, Suite 800 
Houston, Texas 77002 

Dear Mr. Prior: 

CPF  3-2023-003-NOPV 

From March 29, 2021 through February 1, 2022, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous 
Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), pursuant to Chapter 
601 of 49 United States Code (U.S.C.) inspected your pipeline facilities and records in North 
Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, and Illinois. 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that you have committed probable violations of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The items inspected 
and the probable violations are: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
   
 
 
 
 
1. 

§ 195.412  Inspection of rights-of-way and crossings under navigable waters. 
(a)  Each operator shall, at intervals not exceeding 3 weeks, but at least 26 times 
each calendar year, inspect the surface conditions on or adjacent to each pipeline 
right-of-way. Methods of inspection include walking, driving, flying or other 
appropriate means of traversing the right-of-way. 

TC Oil Pipeline Operations Inc. (TC Oil) failed to inspect the surface conditions on or adjacent 
to each pipeline right-of-way at intervals not exceeding 3 weeks, but at least 26 times each 
calendar year. Upon inspection, there were eight (8) instances where the right-of-way was not 
inspected using a method that allowed the surface conditions to be observed.

These locations were overgrown with brush and/or tree cover. The records for these locations 
showed the locations were being inspected by aerial patrol. TC Oil indicated on March 18, 2022, 
that since PHMSA’s inspection, three of the locations noted have been converted to foot patrol 
and on August 10, 2023, that all locations had been cleared of overgrowth in 2022. 

2. 

§ 195.402  Procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies 
(a)  . . . . 
(c) Maintenance and normal operations. The manual required by paragraph (a) of 
this section must include procedures for the following to provide safety during 
maintenance and normal operations: 
(3)  Operating, maintaining, and repairing the pipeline system in accordance with 
each of the requirements of this subpart and subpart H of this part. 

TC Oil failed to follow its procedures for operating, maintaining, and repairing the pipelines 
system in accordance with of the requirements of subparts F and H of part 195.  Specifically, TC 
Oil failed to follow its procedure titled “Liquids Facility Piping Non-Destructive and 
Atmospheric Inspection”, section 5.3.2, which requires that an item graded 41, "to be actioned 
within 18 months.  This action may include remediation, testing, monitoring or a risk 
assessment." 

1 TC Oil grades atmospheric corrosion on a scale of 1 through 5, with grade 5 being the worst. 

 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
PHMSA reviewed the atmospheric corrosion inspection record for the STNTO+32_8 MLV site, 
which showed that the site was inspected for atmospheric corrosion on June 7, 2018, and was 
determined to be a grade 4 item, which required TC Oil to take action to address the corrosion 
within 18 months of discovery, pursuant to its procedures. The atmospheric corrosion graded 4 at 
the MLV site was not repaired until June 11, 2020, outside of the 18-month window required by 
the procedure.  During the inspection, TC Oil stated that it “acknowledges that the grade 4 
coating condition identified during the 2018 inspection program at STNTO+32_8 was 
remediated at a date exceeding the 18-month timeline due to an error in scheduling. TCE is 
looking to make improvements to the program to ensure remediation is completed by the 
required timelines."  On December 1, 2022, TC Oil published a new procedure, “Liquids 
Atmospheric Corrosion Inspection (US)” to better manage this program.
