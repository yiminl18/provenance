and 
PROPOSED COMPLIANCE ORDER 

VIA ELECTRONIC MAIL TO:  craig@samgaryjr.com and jeff@samgaryjr.com, 

September 18, 2023 

Mr. Craig Ambler 
President 
Gary Climate Solutions, LLC 
1515 Wynkoop Street, Suite 700 
Denver, CO  80202 

Dear Mr. Ambler: 

CPF 3-2023-021-NOPV 

From August 30 to September 1, 2022, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 
Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS),  pursuant to Chapter 601 of 
49 United States Code (U.S.C.) inspected on-site your carbon dioxide pipeline in Garden City, 
Kansas. 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that you have committed probable violations of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The items inspected 
and the probable violations are: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
1. 

§ 195.61 National Pipeline Mapping System. 
(a) Each operator of a hazardous liquid pipeline facility must provide the following 
geospatial data to PHMSA for that facility: 
(1) Geospatial data, attributes, metadata and transmittal letter appropriate for use 
in the National Pipeline Mapping System. . . 
(2) . . . 
(3) . . . 
(b) This information must be submitted each year, on or before June 15, 
representing assets as of December 31 of the previous year. If no changes have 
occurred since the previous year's submission, the operator must refer to the 
information provided in the NPMS Operator Standards manual available at 
www.npms.phmsa.dot.gov or contact the PHMSA Geographic Information Systems 
Manager at (202) 366–4595. 

GCS failed to make its annual submittal to the NPMS for the calendar year 2018, which 
was due on June 15, 2019.  In response to PHMSA’s request for documentation, GCS 
provided an email exchange indicating that no such submission was made in 2019. 

Consequently, GCS failed to meet the requirements of §195.61. 

2. 

§ 195.402 Procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies. 

(a) General. Each operator shall prepare and follow for each pipeline system a 
manual of written procedures for conducting normal operations and maintenance 
activities and handling abnormal operations and emergencies. . . 

GCS failed to follow its manual of written procedures by failing to perform and 
document emergency training of field personnel.  Section P-195.403 of GCS’s operations 
and maintenance manual requires documentation on Form F-195.403 of the following 
types of training: 

•  Annual supervisory review of O&M and Emergency Response Manual. 
•  Review of P-195.402(e) with personnel, including the characteristics and 

hazards of carbon dioxide and how to react to emergencies. 

•  Participation in an emergency drill or tabletop exercise on an annual basis. 

Form F-195.403 itself states "This form should be used to document training of 
emergency response personnel conducted under Procedure P-195.403: Handling 
Emergencies." 

In response to PHMSA's request for emergency response training records, GCS provided 
sign-in sheets for yearly Kansas Pipeline Association (KPA) first responder training in 
Garden City KS for the years 2017-2021 and a sample tabletop scenario.  However, no 
record of any kind was provided on Form F-195.403, nor was there any documentation 
provided regarding the supervisory review or training of personnel on GCS procedures or 
hazards specific to carbon dioxide. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, it is unclear whether personnel attended the KPA events in 2019 and 2021 as 
the company appears only on the RSVP roster as a sponsor, with no corresponding 
signatures. 

By not performing and documenting the emergency training required by its written 
operations and maintenance procedures, GCS failed to follow §195.403. 

3. 

§ 195.440 Public awareness. 
(a) Each pipeline operator must develop and implement a written continuing public 
education program that follows the guidance provided in the American Petroleum 
Institute's (API) Recommended Practice (RP) 1162 (incorporated by reference, see § 
195.3). 
(b) The operator's program must follow the general program recommendations of 
API RP 1162 and assess the unique attributes and characteristics of the operator's 
pipeline and facilities. 

GCS failed to follow the recommendations of API RP 1162 by not performing an annual 
audit of the implementation of its Public Awareness Plan.  RP 1162 §8.3 states “The 
operator should complete an annual audit or review of whether the program has been 
developed and implemented according to the guidelines in this RP.”  In response to 
PHMSA’s request for documentation of this activity for the years 2017 through 2021, 
GCS submitted an email stating, “It does not appear that PetroSantander had record of 
any self-audits so we do not have any to provide. There will be one conducted by GCS at 
the end of the year 2022 and going forward.” 

By not performing annual audits of its public awareness program per the recommendation 
of RP 1162, GCS failed to follow § 195.440(b). 

4. 

§ 195.505 Qualification program. 
Each operator shall have and follow a written qualification program. The program 
shall include provisions to: 
(a) Identify covered tasks; 
(b) Ensure through evaluation that individuals performing covered tasks are 
qualified. . . 

GCS failed to follow the requirements of its written qualification program by not 
reviewing and approving contractor operator qualification (OQ) requirements.  Appendix 
F of the GCS Operator Qualification Program states: “The Company Program 
Administrator will review the contractor’s current qualifications, criteria, SOC, AOC’s 
and evaluation processes to ensure that it meets the Company’s qualification 
requirements.  After a full review/assessment of the OQ qualifications, the Program 
Administrator will develop a matrix to show which tasks are acceptable and meet the 
company’s current CT list. The Company approved list will then be communicated to 
applicable internal and contract personnel and included as part of this exhibit. Records of 
approved contractor qualifications will be maintained within the company’s internal OQ 
program files.” 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
GCS employs contractors for some covered tasks, including cathodic protection 
monitoring and integrity assessment.  In response to PHMSA’s request for documentation 
of this activity, GCS did not provide any record of reviewing and/or approving contractor 
OQ, stating via email that “[n]o documentation of GCS’s review and approval of 
contractors’ operator qualification (OQ) programs have been obtained since GCS 
acquired the pipeline in 2021. In current practice, GCS has notified all contractors that we 
currently use to forward a copy of their OQ plan to GCS. Those plans will then be 
reviewed and keep on record.” 

By not reviewing contractor OQ programs, GCS failed to follow its written qualification 
program and therefore violated § 195.505(b). 

5. 

§ 195.505 Qualification program. 
Each operator shall have and follow a written qualification program. . . 

GCS failed to follow the requirements of its written qualification program by not 
reviewing the program each calendar year at intervals not exceeding 15 months.  Section 
10.2 of the GCS Operator Qualification Program states: 

“The program shall be reviewed every fifteen months, but at least once each calendar 
year. . .” 

The OQ Program document includes a revision log listing edits made in recent years, but 
no revision or review for calendar years 2018 and 2020 is shown.  In response to 
PHMSA’s request for documentation of these annual reviews, GCS stated via email that 
“[n]o annual review of OQ program from 2018 and 2020, under Petrosantander 
were found in files received after acquisition.” 

By not reviewing the OQ program on an annual basis, GCS failed to follow its written 
OQ procedures and therefore violated § 195.505. 

6. 

§ 195.588 What standards apply to direct assessment? 
(a) If you use direct assessment on an onshore pipeline to evaluate the effects of 
external corrosion or stress corrosion cracking, you must follow the requirements of 
this section… 
(b) The requirements for performing external corrosion direct assessment are as 
follows: (1) General. You must follow the requirements of NACE SP0502 
(incorporated by reference, see § 195.3). Also, you must develop and implement a 
External Corrosion Direct Assessment (ECDA) plan that includes procedures 
addressing pre-assessment, indirect examination, direct examination, and post-
assessment. 
(2) . . . 
(3) Indirect examination. In addition to the requirements in Section 4 of NACE 
SP0502 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3), the procedures for indirect 
examination of the ECDA regions must include— 

 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
(i) . . . 
(ii) Criteria for identifying and documenting those indications that must be 
considered for excavation and direct examination, including at least the following: 
(A) The known sensitivities of assessment tools; 
(B) The procedures for using each tool; and 
(C) . . . 
(iii) For each indication identified during the indirect examination, criteria for— 
(A) Defining the urgency of excavation and direct examination of the indication; and 
(B) Defining the excavation urgency as immediate, scheduled, or monitored; and 
(iv) Criteria for scheduling excavations of indications in each urgency level. 
(4) Direct examination. In addition to the requirements in Section 5 of NACE 
SP0502 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3), the procedures for direct 
examination of indications from the indirect examination must include— 
(i) . . . 
(ii) Criteria for deciding what action should be taken if either: 
(A) Corrosion defects are discovered that exceed allowable limits (Section 5.5.2.2 of 
NACE SP0502 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3) provides guidance for 
criteria); or 
(B) Root cause analysis reveals conditions for which ECDA is not suitable (Section 
5.6.2 of NACE SP0502 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3) provides guidance 
for criteria); 
(iii) Criteria and notification procedures for any changes in the ECDA plan, 
including changes that affect the severity classification, the priority of direct 
examination, and the time frame for direct examination of indications. . . 

GCS failed to follow the requirements of §195.588 by not developing and implementing 
an External Corrosion Direct Assessment plan prior to conducting the 2018 ECDA.  In 
response to PHMSA’s request for the ECDA plan, GCS provided section 2.02 of its 
Integrity Management Plan (IMP).  This section discusses the ECDA approach in generic 
terms, but does not include all the elements required by §195.588. Specifically, 

-

-

-

-

IMP § 2.02 does not include any criteria or procedure for classifying indications 
observed during the indirect assessment phase as severe, moderate, or minor. 

IMP § 2.02 does not include meaningful criteria for prioritizing anomaly excavation 
urgency as immediate, scheduled, or monitored. 

IMP § 2.02 does not include criteria and notification procedures for any changes to 
the ECDA plan. 

IMP § 2.02 does not include criteria for deciding what action(s) to take if root cause 
analysis reveals conditions for which ECDA is not suitable. 

By not developing and implementing an ECDA plan meeting the requirements of 
§195.588, GCS failed to follow the regulation.
