Julio Cintron 
Director of LNG Operations 
Crowley LNG Puerto Rico, LLC 
Carretera Pr -337, Km 3.6, Barrio Tallaboa 
Peñuelas, Puerto Rico 00624 

Dear Mr. Cintron: 

CPF 4-2023-057-NOPV 

On June 29, 2022, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety 
Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 
United States Code (U.S.C.) inspected Crowley LNG Puerto Rico’s (Crowley) LNG truck 
loading facility in San Juan, Puerto Rico. 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that Crowley has committed a probable violation of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.). The item inspected 
and the probable violation is: 

1. 

§ 193.2101 Scope. 

(a) Each  LNG  facility  designed  after  March  31,  2000  must 
comply with the requirements of this part and of NFPA–59A–2001 
(incorporated  by  reference,  see  §  193.2013).  If  there  is  a  conflict 
between  this  Part  and  NFPA–59A–2001,  the  requirements  in  this 
part prevail. 

Crowley failed to design its LNG facility in accordance with NFPA–59A–2001 as required by 
§ 193.2101(a). Specifically, Crowley failed to provide controls located at the truck loading area 
that can stop the operation of remotely located pumps used for loading tank cars or tank vehicles, 
as required by section 8.3.1 of NFPA–59A–2001. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Crowley operates an LNG truck loading facility that receives LNG from in-tank pumps that are 
remotely located at the LNG Import Terminal operated by EcoEléctrica. Crowley’s truck loading 
facility failed to incorporate a device that, when initiated, shuts down the LNG in-tank pumps in 
an emergency. 

During the inspection, PHMSA discovered that the Crowley truck transfer area did not have the 
capability to shut down the LNG in-tank pumps located on the EcoEléctrica LNG Import 
Terminal site. Rather, Crowley’s Emergency Shutdown system uses a series of automated 
isolation valves to stop flow to the truck loading facility. However, because Crowley did not 
install the capability to remotely shut down the EcoEléctrica LNG in-tank pumps, Crowley failed 
to provide controls at the truck loading area for the purpose of stopping the operation of remotely 
located pumps used for loading tank cars or tank vehicles, as required in section 8.3.1 of NFPA– 
59A–2001. 

Therefore, Crowley failed to design its LNG facility in accordance with NFPA–59A–2001 as 
required by § 193.2101(a).
