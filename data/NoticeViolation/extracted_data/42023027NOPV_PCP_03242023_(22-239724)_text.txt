and

CERTIFIED MAIL - RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED 

March 24, 2023 

Eric Amundsen 
Senior Vice President, Operations 
Sea Robin Pipeline Company 
1300 Main Street 
Houston, TX 77002 

Dear Mr. Amundsen: 

CPF 4-2023-027-NOPV 

From February 28 through June 23, 2022, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 
Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 
United  States  Code  (U.S.C.)  inspected  Sea  Robin  Pipeline  Company’s  (Sea  Robin)  Offshore 
Pipeline System in the Gulf of Mexico and Louisiana. 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that Sea Robin has committed a probable violation of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The item inspected and 
the probable violation is: 

1. 

§ 192.605 Procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies.  

(a)  General.  Each  operator  shall  prepare  and  follow  for  each 
pipeline, a manual of written procedures for conducting operations and 
maintenance activities and for emergency response. For transmission 
lines, the manual must also include procedures for handling abnormal 
operations. This manual must be reviewed and updated by the operator 
at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each calendar 
year.  This  manual  must  be  prepared  before  operations  of  a  pipeline 
system  commence.  Appropriate  parts  of  the  manual  must  be  kept  at 
locations where operations and maintenance activities are conducted. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
§ 192.481 Atmospheric corrosion control: Monitoring. 

(a) …. 
(c)  If  atmospheric  corrosion  is  found  during  an  inspection,  the 
operator must provide protection against the corrosion as required by 
§ 192.479. 

Sea Robin failed to provide protection against atmospheric corrosion found during an inspection 
in accordance with § 192.481(c) and its procedures.  Specifically, Sea Robin failed to remediate 
atmospheric  corrosion  found  during  an  inspection  at  the  Vermillion  149  platform  within  one 
calendar year, not to exceed 15 months, in accordance with its procedures and § 192.605(a). 

Sea Robin’s procedures, D.40 Corrosion Control Remedial Action (D.40), requires remediation 
“of offshore atmospheric corrosion protection within one calendar year following discovery, not 
to exceed 15 months from the date deficiencies were discovered.”  During Sea Robin’s inspection 
on April 15-16, 2019, it discovered several  areas  on the  Vermillion 149 platform  that required 
remediation  of  atmospheric  corrosion  control.    Specifically,  the  “[g]as  coolers  ha[d]  severe 
corrosion that need to be blasted and painted,” and “[a]ll 3 [compressor] units and unit piping need 
to be blasted and painted.” 

On  June  23,  2022,  PHMSA  inspected  the  Vermillion  149  platform  and  observed  that  the 
remediation had not been completed on compressors 1 and 2 or the gas coolers.  Compressor 3 had 
been disconnected from service. Additionally, Sea Robin blocked gas flow to the compressor area 
in November 2021. 

On  August  8,  2022,  after  the  inspection,  Sea  Robin  completed  the  remediation  and  provided 
records and photographs of the completed remediations. 

Therefore, Sea Robin failed to provide protection against atmospheric corrosion found during an 
inspection in accordance with § 192.481(c) and its procedures.
