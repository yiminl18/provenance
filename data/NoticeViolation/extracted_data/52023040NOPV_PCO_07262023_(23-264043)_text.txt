NOTICE OF PROBABLE VIOLATION 
and 
PROPOSED COMPLIANCE ORDER 

VIA ELECTRONIC MAIL TO MR. LOUIS ZYLSTRA 

July 26, 2023 

Mr. Louis Zylstra 
Sr. Vice President 
E&B Natural Resources Management Corp 
249 E. Ocean Blvd., Suite 900 
Long Beach, CA 90802 

Dear Mr. Zylstra: 

CPF 5-2023-040-NOPV 

From March 21, 2023, to March 23, 2023, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous 
Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), pursuant to Chapter 
601 of 49 United States Code (U.S.C.), inspected E&B Natural Resources Management Corp’s 
(E&B) PXP Gathering System in Los Angeles, California. 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that you have committed probable violations of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The items inspected   
and the probable violations are: 

1. 

§192.481 Atmospheric corrosion control: Monitoring. 

(a)  Each operator must inspect and evaluate each pipeline or portion of the pipeline 
that is exposed to the atmosphere for evidence of atmospheric corrosion, as follows: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pipeline type: 
(1) Onshore other than a Service Line 

(2) Onshore Service Line 

(3) Offshore 

Then the frequency of inspection is: 
At least once every 3 calendar years, but 
with intervals not exceeding 39 months. 
At least once every 5 calendar years, but 
with intervals not exceeding 63 months, 
except as provided in paragraph (d) of 
this section. 
At least once each calendar year, but with 
intervals not exceeding 15 months. 

E&B failed to inspect and evaluate the pipeline for evidence of atmospheric corrosion at least 
every 3 calendar years, with intervals not exceeding 39 months, as required. Specifically, during 
the March 2023 inspection, PHMSA reviewed E&B records which demonstrated it had not 
conducted an atmospheric corrosion inspection on the PXP Gathering System since it assumed 
operation of the pipeline on March 30, 2018. 

Therefore, E&B failed to comply with § 192.481(a) by not conducting atmospheric corrosion 
control monitoring on the pipeline at least every three years, with intervals not exceeding 39 
months. 

2. 

§ 192.479 - Atmospheric corrosion control; General. 

(a) Each operator must clean and coat each pipeline or portion of pipeline that is 
exposed to the atmosphere, except pipelines under paragraph (c) of this section. 

E&B failed to clean and coat each portion of the pipeline exposed to the atmosphere, as required. 
During the inspection, the inspector observed multiple portions of the pipeline within the 
Inglewood Oil Field which had little or no remaining paint, and had significant visible rust on the 
pipe. 

Therefore, E&B failed to comply with § 192.479(a) by failing to clean and coat each portion of 
the pipeline that is exposed to the atmosphere. 

Proposed Civil Penalty 
Under 49 U.S.C. § 60122 and 49 CFR § 190.223, you are subject to a civil penalty not to exceed 
$257,664 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,576,627 for a 
related series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after March 21, 2022 and before 
January 6, 2023, the maximum penalty may not exceed $239,142 per violation per day the 
violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,391,412 for a related series of violations.  For violation 
occurring on or after May 3, 2021 and before March 21, 2022, the maximum penalty may not 
exceed $225,134 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,251,334 for 
a related series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after January 11, 2021 and before 
May 3, 2021, the maximum penalty may not exceed $222,504 per violation per day the violation 
persists, up to a maximum of $2,225,034 for a related series of violations.  For violation 
occurring on or after July 31, 2019 and before January 11, 2021, the maximum penalty may not 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
exceed $218,647 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,186,465 for 
a related series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after November 27, 2018 and before 
July 31, 2019, the maximum penalty may not exceed $213,268 per violation per day, with a 
maximum penalty not to exceed $2,132,679.  For violation occurring on or after November 2, 
2015 and before November 27, 2018, the maximum penalty may not exceed $209,002 per 
violation per day, with a maximum penalty not to exceed $2,090,022. 

We have reviewed the circumstances and supporting documents involved in this case, and have 
decided not to propose a civil penalty assessment at this time.

In regard to Item Number 1 of the Notice pertaining to atmospheric corrosion 
inspections, E&B must conduct atmospheric corrosion inspection on all segments 
of its pipeline within 30 days of receipt of the Final Order. 

In regard to Item Number 2 of the Notice pertaining to pipeline coating, E&B 
must clean and coat its pipeline exposed to the atmosphere within the Inglewood 
Oil Field within 90 days of receipt of the Final Order. 

It  is requested (not mandated) that E&B maintain documentation of the safety 
improvement costs associated with fulfilling this Compliance Order and submit
