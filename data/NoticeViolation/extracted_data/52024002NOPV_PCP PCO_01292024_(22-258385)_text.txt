Dear Mayor Dustin: 

CPF 5-2024-002-NOPV 

From December 19, 2022, to December 20, 2022, representatives of the Colorado Public Utilities 
Commission (COPUC), pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 United States Code (U.S.C.), inspected 
the distribution integrity management program (DIMP) for Lines 1, 2 and 3 on the Town of 
Walden Gas Utility’s (Town of Walden) natural gas distribution system managed by Pinedale 
Natural Gas (Pinedale) in Englewood, Colorado. 

The inspection was prompted by a recent incident that released approximately 6.12 million cubic 
feet of natural gas into the atmosphere from August 31, 2022, to September 2, 2022. This 
incident involved the three pipelines inspected: Line 1,  a 2-inch coated steel line installed in 
1958, Line 2, a 3-inch coated steel line that runs parallel to Line 1 installed in 1979, and Line 3,  
a 2-inch coated steel line that previously was unknown to COPUC prior to the incident. The 
facts, as reported by the Town of Walden and Pinedale, regarding the incident are as follows: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  On May 10, 2022, Pinedale discovered a leak on Line 1. 
•  On July 28, 2022, Pinedale found and repaired a corrosion pinhole leak on Line 1. 
•  On August 31, 2022, Pinedale received a phone call from the Colorado Interstate Gas (CIG) 
control center indicating flow through CIG’s transmission system had increased by a factor 
of 10 since August 23, 2022, suggesting a leak. 

•  On September 1, 2022, Pinedale attempted to find the source of the gas loss by 

systematically isolating sections of the system and checking for pressure drops. Low pressure 
was observed on Line 1. 

•  On September 2, 2022, Pinedale discovered the location of the leak on Line 1, and shut in 

Line 1 to stop the leak, pending repair. Line 2 continued to supply natural gas to the Town of 
Walden. 

•  On September 8, 2022, Pinedale received the August 2022 gas volume statement from CIG. 
•  On October 7, 2022, Pinedale received the September 2022 gas volume statement from CIG. 
•  On October 25, 2022, Pinedale reported the incident to the National Response Center. 
•  On November 2, 2022, Pinedale began excavating the Line 1 leak area, in order to make the 
repair. 60-feet of Line 1 near the area of the July 28th repair was excavated, but no leak was 
found. The excavated material was black and smelled of odorant (“leak dirt"). After Line 1 
was repressurized, a leak detector indicated the presence of gas. Pinedale continued 
excavating and found another 2-inch line (Line 3) about 7 feet away from Line 1, which was 
also surrounded by “leak dirt”. Pinedale chronicled that Line 3 was not shown on any maps 
or described in any of the previous operator’s documents. Leaks from Line 3 were not readily 
detectable, but when gas was introduced, it was found to be leaking in four places. 

•  On November 2, 2022, Pinedale decided to permanently abandon Lines 1 and 3 for a total of 

17,000 feet of pipeline. 
It was concluded that the leak on Line 3 persisted for decades before discovery. 

• 
•  On November 3, 2022, Pinedale filed Department of Transportation (DOT) Form RSPA F 

7100.1 to Pipeline Hazardous Materials and Safety Administration (PHMSA). 

On November 28, 2022, Pinedale welded caps on both ends of the 17,000 ft of pipeline at the 
Bonanza Creek Hub and the Michigan River Valve. As a result of the COPUC’s investigation, it 
appears Town of Walden has committed probable violations of the Pipeline Safety Regulations, 
Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations. The items inspected and the probable violations are: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. 

§ 191.5 Immediate notice of certain incidents. 

(a) At the earliest practicable moment following discovery, but no later than one 
hour after confirmed discovery, each operator must give notice in accordance with 
paragraph (b) of this section of each incident as defined in § 191.3. 

Town of Walden failed to give immediate notice of the August 31, 2022, incident to the National 
Response Center (NRC). On August 31, 2022, Pinedale received a phone call from CIG 
indicating flow through the system had increased by a factor of 10 since August 23, 2022, 
suggesting a leak. Pinedale subsequently investigated, discovered a leak, and initiated mitigation 
measures and repairs within days of the initial indication of a pipeline failure. The estimated 
volume of the leak exceeded the reporting requirement threshold as stated in § 191.3. However, 
the notice of the incident was not submitted to the NRC until October 25, 2022, approximately 
55 days after discovery.1 

Therefore, Town of Walden failed to give immediate notice, but no later than one hour after 
confirmed discovery, of the incident to the NRC as required. 

2. 

§ 191.9 Distribution system: Incident report. 

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, each operator of a 
distribution pipeline system shall submit Department of Transportation Form 
RSPA F 7100.1 as soon as practicable but not more than 30 days after detection of 
an incident required to be reported under § 191.5. 

Town of Walden failed to submit DOT Form RSPA F 7100.1 as soon as practicable but not more 
than 30 days after detection of the August 31, 2022 incident, as referenced above. Pinedale 
submitted the required DOT Form RSPA F 7100.1 on November 3, 2022, approximately 64 days 
after the detection of an incident. When reviewing the document, the incident report indicates, in 
Part A – Key Report Information, the earliest date the incident reporting criterion was met 
occurred on August 31, 2022. 

Therefore, Town of Walden failed to submit to the DOT Form RSPA F 7100.1 within 30 days of 
the detection of the incident as required. 

3. 

§ 192.605 Procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies. 

(a) General.  Each operator shall prepare and follow for each pipeline, a manual of 
written procedures for conducting operations and maintenance activities and for 
emergency response. For transmission lines, the manual must also include 
procedures for handling abnormal operations. This manual must be reviewed and 
updated by the operator at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each 
calendar year. This manual must be prepared before operations of a pipeline system 
commence. Appropriate parts of the manual must be kept at locations where 
operations and maintenance activities are conducted. 

1 See NRC Report #1350815 (“Incident: DISCOVERED on 8/31/2022 local incident time”). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Town of Walden failed to follow its written procedures for conducting operations and 
maintenance activities. Specifically, Pinedale failed to follow O&M Manual Section 400.8 
Inspecting Uncovered Pipeline for completing an Exposed Pipe Report. During the inspection, 
Pinedale was unable to provide any records that indicated Pinedale documented the condition of 
the exposed pipe during the November 2, 2022, excavation activities.2 As a result, Pinedale was 
unable to determine whether additional corrosion requiring remedial action existed in the vicinity 
of the exposed portion as required by its Operations and Maintenance Manual (O&M Manual). 

Additionally, Pinedale failed to follow O&M Manual Section 650.3 Abandonment of Mains and 
Services. O&M Manual Section 650.3 states only pipe sections less than 500 ft. and smaller than 
2-inch diameter not to be purged. During the inspection, Pinedale was unable to provide any 
records indicating that the abandoned pipeline section of 17,000 feet was purged prior to 
abandonment. 

Furthermore, Pinedale failed to follow O&M Manual Section 655.3 Purging Precautions. During 
the inspection, Pinedale provided records demonstrating that the final concentration of gas was 
checked with a Sensit Gold G2 leak detector. However, records did not adequately establish the 
abandoned pipeline contained "less than 1% gas in air”. 

Therefore, Town of Walden failed to follow its O&M manual as required per § 192.605(a). 

4. 

§ 192.617 Investigation of failures and incidents. 

(a) Post-failure and incident procedures.  Each operator must establish and follow 
procedures for investigating and analyzing failures and incidents as defined in § 
191.3, including sending the failed pipe, component, or equipment for laboratory 
testing or examination, where appropriate, for the purpose of determining the 
causes and contributing factor(s) of the failure or incident and minimizing the 
possibility of a recurrence. 

Town of Walden failed to follow its procedures for investigating and analyzing failures and 
incidents as required. Specifically, Pinedale failed to follow O&M Manual Section 260 
Investigation of Failures. During the inspection, Pinedale was unable to provide any records 
indicating Pinedale attempted to determine the causes and contributing factors for the failures 
and incidents that occurred and were related to the August 31, 2022, incident. 

Therefore, Town of Walden failed to investigate and analyze the incident as required per § 
192.617(a). 

5. 

§ 192.805 Qualification program. 

Each operator shall have and follow a written qualification program. The program 
shall include provisions to: 
(a) . . . 

2 As stated above, Lines 1 and 3 were exposed as part of the November 2, 2022, investigation and repair of the 
August 31, 2022, leak. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(b) Ensure through evaluation that individuals performing covered tasks are 
qualified; 

Town of Walden failed to confirm through evaluation that individuals performing covered tasks 
were qualified. Specifically, Pinedale personnel did not have the requisite Operator 
Qualifications (OQs) while performing Covered Task 34 - §192.741 Abandonment or 
deactivation of facilities on November 28, 2022. This covered task is identified in Pinedale’s OQ 
Plan, Attachment E Identified Covered Tasks. 

Therefore, Town of Walden failed to comply with § 192.805(c) as required.

PROPOSED COMPLIANCE ORDER 

Pursuant to 49 United States Code § 60118, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration (PHMSA) proposes to issue to Pinedale a Compliance Order incorporating the
following remedial requirements to ensure the compliance of Town of Walden with the pipeline
safety regulations: 

A. 

B. 

C. 

D. 

In regard to Item Number 3 of the Notice pertaining to failure to follow written 
procedures for conducting operations and maintenance activities, Town of 
Walden must confirm the abandoned pipeline was purged prior to abandonment 
as required by O&M Manual Section 650.3 Abandonment of Mains and Services 
within 90 days of receipt of the Final Order. 

In regard to Item Number 4 of the Notice pertaining to failure to follow 
procedures for investigating and analyzing failures and incidents, Town of 
Walden must investigate and analyze the failures and incident as required by 
O&M Manual Section 260 Investigation of Failures within 90 days of receipt of 
the Final Order. Specifically, in order to determine the causes and contributing 
factors of the failures and incident, and to minimize the possibility of a 
recurrence, Town of Walden must send the failed pipe for laboratory testing. 
Additionally, Town of Walden must develop, implement, and incorporate lessons 
learned from a post-failure or incident review into its written procedures. 

In regard to Item Number 5 of the Notice pertaining to failure to confirm through 
evaluation that individuals performing covered tasks are qualified, Town of 
Walden must implement a comprehensive OQ program review within 90 days of
