Mr. Scott Knight 
Vice President of HSE and Regulatory 
DCOR, LLC 
1000 Town Center Dr., Suite 600 
Oxnard, CA 93036 

Dear Mr. Knight: 

CPF 5-2023-037-NOPV 

From September 12 through 16, 2022, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 
Safety Administration (PHMSA), pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 United States Code, conducted 
an on-site pipeline safety inspection of the pipeline system that serves the Platform Gina, 
Platform Gilda and the Mandalay Onshore Separation Facility (MOSF) of DCOR, LLC in 
Ventura, California. 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that DCOR, LLC (DCOR) has committed probable 
violations of the Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The 
items inspected and the probable violations are: 

1. 

§ 195.402 Procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies. 

(a) General. Each operator shall prepare and follow for each pipeline system a 
manual of written procedures for conducting normal operations and maintenance 
activities and handling abnormal operations and emergencies. This manual shall be 
reviewed at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each calendar year, 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
and appropriate changes made as necessary to insure that the manual is effective. 
This manual shall be prepared before initial operations of a pipeline system 
commence, and appropriate parts shall be kept at locations where operations and 
maintenance activities are conducted. 

DCOR failed to follow for each pipeline system a manual of written procedures for conducting 
normal operations and maintenance activities and handling abnormal operations and emergencies 
on two occasions: 

(1) DCOR failed to follow its Operation, Maintenance & Emergency Plan (OME) Hazardous 
Liquid & Natural Gas Pipeline Procedures, HL3.04, Section 5.1.21. At the time of PHMSA 
inspection, DCOR could not provide the 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 records to demonstrate that 
liaison with fire, police, and other appropriate public officials to learn the responsibility and 
resources of each government organization that may respond to a hazardous liquid or carbon 
dioxide pipeline emergency and acquaint the officials with the operator's ability in responding to 
a hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide pipeline emergency and means of communication has been 
established and maintained. 

(2) DCOR failed to follow its HL3.04 - Operation, Maintenance & Emergency Plan (OME) 
Hazardous Liquid & Natural Gas Pipeline Procedures, HL 7.01, Section 42. At the time of the 
PHMSA Inspection, DCOR could not provide 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 records to 
demonstrate that valve SDV-11A has been inspected as required by § 195.420.

instruct emergency response personnel to: 

DCOR failed to conduct a continuing training program to instruct emergency response personnel 
to: (1) Carry out the emergency procedures established under 195.402 that relate to their 
assignments; (2) Know the characteristics and hazards of the hazardous liquids or carbon dioxide 
transported, including, in case of flammable HVL, flammability of mixtures with air, odorless 
vapors, and water reactions; (3) Recognize conditions that are likely to cause emergencies, 
predict the consequences of facility malfunctions or failures and hazardous liquids or carbon 
dioxide spills, and take appropriate corrective action; (4) Take steps necessary to control any 
accidental release of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide and to minimize the potential for fire, 
explosion, toxicity, or environmental damage; and (5) Learn the potential causes, types, sizes, 
and consequences of fire and the appropriate use of portable fire extinguishers and other on-site 
fire control equipment, involving, where feasible, a simulated pipeline emergency condition. At 
the time of PHMSA inspection, DCOR could not provide the 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 
records to demonstrate compliance with § 195.403(a).
