Coffeyville Resources Crude Transportation, LLC 
P.O. Box 3516 
411 N.E. Washington Boulevard 
Bartlesville, Oklahoma  74006 

CPF 3-2023-008-NOPV 

Dear Mr. Lamp: 

From August 23, 2021 to October 4, 2021, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous 
Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), pursuant to Chapter 
601 of 49 United States Code (U.S.C.), inspected Coffeyville Resources Crude Transportation, 
LLC’s (CRCT) Hazardous Liquids Crude Pipeline System in Oklahoma and Kansas. 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that CRCT has committed probable violations of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The items inspected 
and the probable violations are: 

1. 

§ 195.412  Inspection of rights-of-way and crossings under navigable waters. 
(a)  Each Operator shall, at intervals not exceeding 3 weeks, but at least 26 times 
each calendar year, inspect the surface conditions on or adjacent to each pipeline 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
right-of-way.  Methods of inspection include walking, driving, flying or other 
appropriate means of traversing the right-of-way. 

CRCT failed to satisfy the requirements of § 195.412(a) by not using an appropriate 
method for inspection of pipeline right-of-way.  During the field inspection at the 
Hooser-Broome 8” pipeline segment west of Bee Creek Valve (Lat. 37.053019, Long. -
95.966233), PHMSA observed that CRCT failed to adequately clear the right-of-way of 
tree cover, thereby preventing effective aerial patrolling.  The right-of-way was covered 
by a dense tree canopy extending approximately 1,200 feet, which prevented details of 
the surface conditions on and adjacent to each pipeline right-of-way from being observed. 
An appropriate means of inspecting the right-of-way in light of these obstructions, such 
as walking or driving along the right-of-way, was not performed. Therefore, CRCT is in 
violation of § 195.412(a). 

2. 

§ 195.573  What must I do to monitor external corrosion? 
(a)  Protected pipelines.  You must do the following to determine whether cathodic 
protection required by this subpart complies with § 195.571: 
(1)  Conduct tests on the protected pipeline at least once each calendar year, but 
with intervals not exceeding 15 months.  However, if tests at those intervals are 
impractical for separately protected short sections of bare or ineffectively coated 
pipelines, testing may be done at least once every 3 calendar years, but with 
intervals not exceeding 39 months. 

CRCT failed to satisfy the requirements of § 195.573(a)(1) by not performing cathodic 
protection testing on the protected Shidler pipeline segment within the required interval 
of at least once each calendar year, but not exceeding 15 months. 

From a review of CRCT’s records, PHMSA found that the Shidler cathodic protection 
test surveys were conducted on 2/28/18 and 6/17/19, which exceeded the allowable 15-
month interval by 20 days.  Therefore, CRCT is in violation of § 195.573(a)(1).  This 
violation was issued as a Warning in CPF #320195021, Item #2. 

CRCT did not demonstrate that tests at least once each calendar year, but with intervals 
not exceeding 15 months, were impractical for the affected pipeline segment. 

3. 

§ 195.573  What must I do to monitor external corrosion? 
(a)  . . . . 
(e)  Corrective action.  You must correct any identified deficiency in corrosion 
control as required by § 195.401(b).  However, if the deficiency involves a pipeline in 
an integrity management program under § 195.452, you must correct the deficiency 
as required by § 195.452(h). 

CRCT failed to correct identified deficiencies in its corrosion control.  From the 
inspection of corrosion control records, PHMSA found that CRCT’s inspections in 
calendar years 2020 and 2021 for four of its steel breakout tanks showed that the 
minimum protection criteria of NACE SP 0169 was not met as required by § 195.571. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The following test sites showed deficient cathodic protection (CP) in which a minimum 
negative polarization of 850mV was not achieved for two consecutive inspections.

CRCT was unable to provide a record that it had corrected these deficiencies at the time 
of the inspection.  Due to the identified deficiencies in 2020 not being corrected by the 
time of the next annual inspection in 2021, CRCT is in violation of § 195.573(e).  This 
violation is a repeat of violation found in CPF # 320195021, Item # 1. 

4. 

§ 195.581 Which pipelines must I protect against atmospheric corrosion and what 
coating material may I use? 
(a) You must clean and coat each pipeline or portion of pipeline that is exposed to 
the atmosphere, except pipelines under paragraph (c) of this section. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CRCT failed to provide protection against atmospheric corrosion by cleaning and coating 
each pipeline or portion of pipeline that is exposed to the atmosphere. During PHMSA’s 
field inspection from September 28 through October 7, 2021, severely degraded and dis-
bonded coating and large sections of rusted/corroded bare steel were observed on 
exposed portions of CRCT’s pipelines at the following six locations: 

•  Hooser to Broome 8” line segment at Bee Creek Valve; 
•  Kelley to Barnsdall 8” line segment at exposures #78, #51, #48, #27 and #4. 

From a review of consecutive inspection reports for 2016 and 2019 at each of the five 
exposures on the Kelley to Barnsdall pipeline, it was found that the condition was graded 
as “D-Critical” and “coating repair required.”  CRCT failed to repair the coating and 
provided no evidence of tests or evaluations of these locations to show that the observed 
corrosion would not affect the safe operation of the pipe before the next scheduled 
inspection under the requirements of § 195.581(c). Therefore, CRCT is in violation of § 
195.581(a). 

5. 

§ 195.589 What corrosion control information do I have to maintain? 
(a) . . . . 
(c) You must maintain a record of each analysis, check, demonstration, 
examination, inspection, investigation, review, survey, and test required by this 
subpart in sufficient detail to demonstrate the adequacy of corrosion control 
measures or that corrosion requiring control measures does not exist.  You must 
retain these records for at least 5 years, except that records relating to §§ 195.569, 
195.573(a) and (b), and 195.579(b)(3) and (c) must be retained for as long as the 
pipeline remains in service. 

During the inspection PHMSA found that CRCT failed to maintain records of cathodic 
protection surveys for calendar years 2018 and 2019 for East Tank Farm breakout tanks 
22A1, 22A2, 22A3 and Hooser Tanks 25 and 270 due to a data processing error 
discovered in 2020.  A device was used to allow field personnel to capture cathodic 
protection readings and recorded those readings within the internal memory of the device.  
Due to the internal memory limitations of the reader, which at the time was unknown, 
data was overwritten when performing surveys across the system.  The overwritten data 
was unable to be recovered. Therefore, CRCT is in violation of § 195.589(c).
