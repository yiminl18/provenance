Dear Ms. Hansen: 

From February 22, 2022, and throughout 2022, representatives of the Pipeline and Hazardous 
Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), pursuant to Chapter 
601 of 49 United States Code (U.S.C.), investigated the February 21, 2022, in-service failure of 
Texas Eastern Transmission, LP’s (TETLP) Line 11 in DeSoto Parish, Louisiana. 

On February 21, 2022, at 11:25 pm Central Standard Time (CST), TETLP experienced an in-
service failure of Line 11, near Mile Post 247 in DeSoto Parish, Louisiana (“the incident”). The 
24-inch diameter pipeline was operating at 901 psi at the time of failure, and the rupture resulted 
in 9 fragments, totaling approximately 110 linear feet of pipe, being ejected from the ground. 
Approximately 37 million cubic feet of natural gas was unintentionally released as a result of the 
incident. The incident occurred in a Class 1 location, and there was no ignition, no injuries, and 
no fatalities. The estimated total cost of the incident, including the gas lost, was $8,293,379.  

 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The incident was caused by mechanical damage that occurred on the pipeline during an integrity 
dig. As denoted in the metallurgical report, the damage included 24 individual gouges located on 
the top portion of the pipe. The integrity dig, Dig 1175, began in October of 2020 but work 
ceased soon thereafter when it was determined that additional space was needed to complete the 
required repairs. Dig 1175 recommenced in May of 2021. 

At some point during the excavation or backfilling activities for Dig 1175, likely during the 
second dig that began in May of 2021, the pipeline was struck resulting in mechanical damage to 
the pipe. According to TETLP, the line strike(s) and resulting mechanical damage were not 
reported by either the second-party excavator or the company representative that was supposed 
to be monitoring and inspecting the excavation activities. The mechanical damage that occurred 
during Dig 1175 left a flaw in the pipe that failed in-service months later on February 21, 2022, 
resulting in a rupture and release of natural gas. 

As a result of the investigation, it is alleged that you have committed a probable violation of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The item investigated 
and the probable violation is: 

1. 

§ 192.605 Procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies. 

(a) General. Each operator shall prepare and follow for each pipeline, a manual of 

written procedures for conducting operations and maintenance activities and for 
emergency response. For transmission lines, the manual must also include 
procedures for handling abnormal operations. This manual must be reviewed 
and updated by the operator at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least 
once each calendar year. This manual must be prepared before operations of a 
pipeline system commence. Appropriate parts of the manual must be kept at 
locations where operations and maintenance activities are conducted. 

The manual required by § 192.605(a) must be followed and must include procedures to 
provide safety for operating, maintaining, and repairing the pipeline. See §192.605(b)(1). 
While performing Dig 1175 to maintain and repair the pipeline, TETLP failed to follow 
its procedure, “Ground Disturbance Specification – U.S.” Version 1.1, dated 11-26-2019. 
Specifically, TETLP failed to maintain a 1-foot buffer around the pipe when using 
mechanical equipment for excavation (see section 6.5) and/or backfilling (see section 
6.12) during an integrity repair, Dig 1175, on Line 11. TETLP’s failure to maintain the 
1-foot buffer resulted in the pipe being struck with equipment used by the second-party 
contractor that caused mechanical damage leading to the subsequent failure in February 
2022. 

These facts were revealed during the root-cause failure analysis conducted by DNV GL 
USA, Inc., and as part of TETLP’s internal investigation of the incident.
