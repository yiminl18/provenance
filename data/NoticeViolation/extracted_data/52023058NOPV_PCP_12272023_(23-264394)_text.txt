and 
PROPOSED CIVIL PENALTY

Mr. Sean Kolassa  
President 
Harvest Alaska, LLC 
1111 Travis St. 
Houston, TX 77002 

Dear Mr. Kolassa: 

CPF 5-2023-058-NOPV 

From April 3 through September 15, 2023, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous 
Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), pursuant to Chapter 
601 of 49 United States Code (U.S.C.), inspected your Cook Inlet Pipeline (CIPL). 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that you have committed probable violations of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The items inspected 
and the probable violations are: 

1. 

§ 195.262 – Pumping Equipment. 

(a) . . . . 
(b) The following must be provided in each pump station: 
(1) Safety devices that prevent overpressuring of pumping equipment, including the 
auxiliary pumping equipment within the pumping station. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Harvest Alaska, LLC (Operator) failed to provide an overpressure prevention safety device for 
an auxiliary pump within a pump station as is required by § 195.262.  Inspectors from PHMSA 
visited the Granite Point pump station for the CIPL on May 14, 2023.  Inspectors observed an 
auxiliary positive displacement style pump utilized for pig trap drain down and reinjection that 
had no apparent overpressure protection. When onsite, the Operator indicated that the pump was 
used as needed for pig trap drain down during pigging operations.  The Operator failed to 
provide an overpressure protection safety device for the auxiliary pump utilized for pig trap drain 
down at the Granite Point pump station as is required.  Accordingly, the Operator is in violation 
of § 195.262.  However, the Operator installed a Pressure Safety Valve (PSV) in July 2023 
because of PHMSA’s inspection. 

2. 

§ 195.428 – Overpressure safety devices and overfill protection systems. 

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each operator shall, at 
intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each calendar year, or in the 
case of pipelines used to carry highly volatile liquids, at intervals not to exceed 7 ½ 
months, but at least twice each calendar year, inspect and test each pressure limiting 
device, relief valve, pressure regulator, or other item of pressure control equipment 
to determine that it is functioning properly, is in good mechanical condition, and is 
adequate from the standpoint of capacity and reliability of operation for the service 
in which it is used. 

The Operator failed to conduct testing and inspection of the overpressure control device PIT-16 
at least once each calendar year and at an interval not to exceed 15 months as is required by § 
195.428.  Specifically, the Operator provided record of inspection and testing of PIT-16 for 
calendar years 2021 and 2023 but did not provide record of inspection and testing of PIT-16 for 
the year 2022. 

PIT-16 is located upstream of the CIPL, and the device is owned and operated by another 
operator that provides crude oil directly piped into the CIPL.  Piping and instrumentation 
diagrams provided by the upstream operator indicate that PIT-16 is located downstream of three 
centrifugal pumps piped in series.  PIT-16 is configured to shut down all three upstream pumps 
and shut in Shutdown Valve 7006 (SDV-7006) when PIT-16 senses a high pressure of 245psig. 
MOP for CIPL is 285psig. 

The Operator was previously warned for a similar issue in CPF 5-2021-015-WL, which cited 
195.428(c) for “failing to conduct the required inspections of the overfill protection devices on 
the crude oil relief tank (Tank 001) at the KPL Junction Facility, where the Cook Inlet Pipeline 
and Swanson River Pipeline systems interconnect.” 

CIPL Operator failed to perform inspection and testing of pressure control device PIT-16 in 2022 
and accordingly, is in violation of §195.428(a).   

3. 

§ 195.452 – Pipeline integrity management in high consequence areas. 

(a) . . . . 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(e) What are the risk factors for establishing an assessment schedule (for both the 
baseline and continual integrity assessments)? 
(1) An operator must establish an integrity assessment schedule that prioritizes 
pipeline segments for assessment (see paragraphs (d)(1) and (j)(3) of this section). 
An operator must base the assessment schedule on all risk factors that reflect the 
risk conditions on the pipeline segment. The factors an operator must consider 
include, but are not limited to:... 

The Operator failed to provide evidence of consideration of mandatory risk factors when 
extending the continual integrity assessment schedule for the CIPL as is required by § 195.452. 

In 2020, the Operator changed the integrity assessment schedule for the 20” segment of the CIPL 
from a four-year to a five-year schedule, resulting in an assessment due in 2021 rather than 2020.  
The provided record of the decision to increase the interval included consideration of some of the 
required risk factors; however, there was no record of the consideration of all required minimum 
factors.  Risk factors not found in the record of consideration included (but are not limited to): 
defect growth rate, pipe coating type and condition, leak history, repair history, cathodic 
protection history, and geotechnical hazards.  The Operator failed to provide record of 
consideration of minimum required risk factors when extending an assessment schedule and 
accordingly is in violation of § 195.452. 

4. 

§ 195.452 – Pipeline integrity management in high consequence areas. 

(a) . . . . 
(i) What preventive and mitigative measures must an operator take to protect the high 
consequence area? 
(1) General requirements. An operator must take measures to prevent and mitigate 
the consequences of a pipeline failure that could affect a high consequence area. 
These measures include conducting a risk analysis of the pipeline segment to 
identify additional actions to enhance public safety or environmental protection. 
Such actions may include, but are not limited to, implementing damage prevention 
best practices, better monitoring of cathodic protection where corrosion is a 
concern, establishing shorter inspection intervals, installing EFRDs on the pipeline 
segment, modifying the systems that monitor pressure and detect leaks, providing 
additional training to personnel on response procedures, conducting drills with local 
emergency responders and adopting other management controls. 

The Operator failed to consider measures to prevent consequences of a pipeline failure in a high 
consequence area as is required by § 195.452. 

PHMSA Inspectors observed the CIPL exposed to the atmosphere (uncovered) at the bottom of a 
bluff immediately upstream of the CIPL’s Cook Inlet crossing.  The bluff appeared to 
historically shed large boulders from higher elevations near the exposed portion of the CIPL. 
Logs were observed to be stacked over the exposed portion of the CIPL, as well as the 
neighboring gas pipeline that was also exposed.  It was unknown to the Operator representatives 
if the placed logs were being utilized to help protect the pipeline in some way.  A review of the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Operator’s 2022 Comprehensive Risk Assessment and Preventative and Mitigative Measures 
Evaluation did not mention preventative measures with regard to this location and circumstances. 
The Operator failed to consider measures to prevent consequences of a pipeline failure in a high 
consequence area and accordingly, is in violation of § 195.452
