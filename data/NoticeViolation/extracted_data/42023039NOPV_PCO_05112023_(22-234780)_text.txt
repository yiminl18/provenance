Dear Mr. Gupta: 

CPF 4-2023-039-NOPV 

From April 11 to November 9, 2022, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 
Safety  Administration  (PHMSA),  pursuant  to  Chapter  601  of  49  United  States  Code  (U.S.C.), 
inspected Bravo Pipeline Company’s (Bravo) carbon dioxide (CO2) transmission pipeline system 
in New Mexico and Texas. 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that Bravo has committed a probable violation of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The item inspected and 
the probable violations is: 

1. 

§ 195.452 Pipeline integrity management in high consequence areas. 

(a) . . . . 
(l) What records must an operator keep to demonstrate compliance? 
(1) An  operator  must  maintain,  for  the  useful  life  of  the  pipeline, 
records  that  demonstrate  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  this 
subpart.  At  a  minimum,  an  operator  must  maintain  the  following 
records for review during an inspection: 

(i) . . . . 
(ii) Documents to support the decisions and analyses, including any 
modifications,  justifications,  deviations  and  determinations  made, 
variances, and actions taken, to implement and evaluate each element 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of  the  integrity  management  program  listed  in paragraph  (f) of  this 
section. 

Bravo  failed  to  maintain  records  to  support  the  decisions  and  analyses,  including  any 
modifications, justifications, variances, deviations, and determinations made, and actions taken, to 
implement  and  evaluate  each  element  integrity  management  program  in  accordance  with  § 
195.452(l)(1)(ii).  Specifically,  Bravo  failed  to  maintain  records  documenting  the  results  of 
integrity management program (IMP) effectiveness reviews in 2020 and 2021. 

Bravo provided presentations of its annual IMP reviews for 2020 and 2021, as well as associated 
meeting notes, but it failed to maintain records documenting the results of its IMP effectiveness 
reviews. 

Therefore, Bravo failed to maintain records to support the decisions and analyses, including any 
modifications, justifications, variances, deviations, and determinations made, and actions taken, to 
implement  and  evaluate  each  element  integrity  management  program  in  accordance  with  § 
195.452(l)(1)(ii). 

Proposed Compliance Order 
Under 49 U.S.C. § 60122 and 49 CFR § 190.223, you are subject to a civil penalty not to exceed 
$257,664 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,576,627 for a related 
series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after March 21, 2022 and before January 6, 
2023, the maximum penalty may not exceed $239,142 per violation per day the violation persists,

per violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,251,334 for a related series of 
violations.  For  violation  occurring  on  or  after  January  11,  2021  and  before  May  3,  2021,  the 
maximum penalty may not exceed $222,504 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a 
maximum of $2,225,034 for a related series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after July 
31,  2019  and  before  January  11,  2021,  the  maximum  penalty  may  not  exceed  $218,647  per 
violation  per  day the  violation  persists,  up to  a  maximum  of  $2,186,465  for  a  related  series  of 
violations.  For violation occurring on or after November 27, 2018 and before July 31, 2019, the 
maximum penalty may not exceed $213,268 per violation per day, with a maximum penalty not to 
exceed $2,132,679.  For violation occurring on or after November 2, 2015 and before November 
27, 2018, the maximum penalty may not exceed $209,002 per violation per day, with a maximum 
penalty not to exceed $2,090,022. 

We have reviewed the circumstances and supporting documents involved in this case, and have 
decided not to propose a civil penalty assessment at this time.

Administration proposes to issue a Compliance Order to Bravo Pipeline Company.  Please refer to
