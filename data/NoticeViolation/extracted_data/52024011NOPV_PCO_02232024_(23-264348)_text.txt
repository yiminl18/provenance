NOTICE OF PROBABLE VIOLATION 
and 
PROPOSED COMPLIANCE ORDER 

VIA ELECTRONIC MAIL TO: MR. SCOTT KNIGHT 

February 23, 2024 

Mr. Scott Knight 
V.P. of HSE and Regulatory 
DCOR LLC 
1000 Town Center, Suite 600 
Oxnard, CA 93036 

Dear Mr. Knight: 

CPF 5-2024-011-NOPV 

From August 1 through August 3, 2023, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 
Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 
United States Code (U.S.C.), inspected DCOR LLC’s (DCOR) Platform A to Rincon crude oil 
pipeline in Ventura, California. 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that DCOR has committed probable violations of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The items inspected   
and the probable violations are: 

1. 

§ 195.403 Emergency response training. 

(a)… 
(b) At the intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each calendar year, 
each operator shall: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1) Review with personnel their performance in meeting the objectives of the 
emergency response training program set forth in paragraph (a) of this section; and 
(2) Make appropriate changes to the emergency response training program as 
necessary to ensure that it is effective. 

DCOR failed to review with personnel their performance in meeting the objectives of the 
emergency response training program at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once 
each calendar year, as required by §195.403(b)(1).  At the time of PHMSA’s inspection, DCOR 
was unable to produce any records that demonstrated that the reviews had taken place. 

Therefore, DCOR failed to review with personnel their performance in meeting the objectives of 
its emergency response training program as required pursuant to § 195.403(b)(1). 

2. 

§ 195.404 Maps and records. 

(a)… 
(b) Each operator shall maintain for at least 3 years daily operating records that 
indicate – 
(1) The discharge pressure at each pump station; and 
(2) Any emergency or abnormal operation to which the procedures under § 195.402 
apply. 

DCOR failed to maintain daily operating records that indicate the discharge pressure at each 
pump station and any abnormal operation to which the procedures under § 195.402(d) apply for 
at least 3 years.  At the time of the PHMSA inspection, DCOR was unable to provide any daily 
operating records. 

Therefore, DCOR failed to maintain daily operating records for at least three years as required 
pursuant to § 195.404(b)(1) and (2). 

3. 

§ 195.404 Maps and records. 

(a)… 
(c) Each operator shall maintain the following records for the periods specified: 
(1)… 
(3) A record of each inspection and test required by this subpart shall be maintained 
for at least 2 years or until the next inspection or test is performed, whichever is 
longer. 

DCOR failed to maintain a record of each inspection and test required by Subpart F for at least 2 
years or until the next inspection or test is performed, as required by § 195.404(c)(3).  At the 
time of the PHMSA inspection, DCOR was unable to provide any records demonstrating that 
PSV ROSF-117 had been inspected at least twice each calendar year, but at intervals not 
exceeding 7 ½ months as required by § 195.420(b). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Therefore, DCOR failed to maintain the inspection and test records required by Subpart F for at 
least 2 years or until the next inspection or test, whichever is longer, as required by § 
195.404(c)(3). 

4. 

§ 195.410 Line markers. 

(a)… 
(c) Each operator shall provide line marking at locations where the line is above 
ground in areas that are accessible to the public. 

DCOR failed to provide line marking at all locations where the line is above ground in areas that 
are accessible to the public.  While onsite, PHMSA observed a test station and casing vent in a 
publicly accessible area that did not have a line marker1. 

Therefore, DCOR failed to provide line markings at all locations where the above ground line is 
accessible to the public as required by § 195.410(c). 

5. 

§ 195.440 Public awareness. 

(a)… 
(i) The operator's program documentation and evaluation results must be available 
for periodic review by appropriate regulatory agencies. 

DCOR failed to make its public awareness program documentation and evaluation results 
available for review by PHMSA as required.  § 195.440(c) requires pipeline operators to follow 
the recommendations of API RP 1162, unless the operator provides justification in its public 
awareness program or procedures as to why the recommendation is not practicable or necessary 
for safety. At the time of the PHMSA inspection, DCOR was unable to provide any records 
demonstrating it had completed an annual review of its public awareness program as required by 
API RP 1162 section 8.3. 

Therefore, DCOR failed to make its public awareness documentation and evaluation results 
available for review to PHMSA as required pursuant to § 195.440(i). 

6. 

§ 195.452 Pipeline integrity management in high consequence areas. 

(a) … 
(l) What records must an operator keep to demonstrate compliance? 
(1) An operator must maintain, for the useful life of the pipeline, records that 
demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this subpart. At a minimum, an 
operator must maintain the following records for review during an inspection: 
(i) … 

1 See Violation Report at Exhibit A 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(ii) Documents  to  support  the  decisions  and  analyses,  including  any  modifications, 
justifications, deviations and determinations made, variances, and actions taken, to 
implement and evaluate each element of the integrity management program listed in 
paragraph (f) of this section. 

DCOR failed to maintain documents to support the decisions and analyses, including any 
modifications, justifications, deviations and determinations made, variances, and actions taken, 
to implement and evaluate each element of the integrity management program listed in 
§195.452(f) on the following occasions: 

(1) At the time of the PHMSA inspection, DCOR was unable to provide records to demonstrate 
the implementation of a means to detect leaks on its pipeline system as required by 
§195.452(i)(3)2. 

(2) At the time of the PHMSA inspection, DCOR was unable to provide records to demonstrate 
the methods used to measure the integrity management program’s effectiveness, as required by 
§195.452(f)(7). 

Therefore, DCOR failed to keep records in accordance with § 195.452(l)(1)(ii) as required. 

7. 

§ 195.575 Which facilities must I electrically isolate and what inspections, tests, and 
safeguards are required? 

(a) You must electrically isolate each buried or submerged pipeline from other 
metallic structures, unless you electrically interconnect and cathodically protect the 
pipeline and the other structures as a single unit. 

DCOR failed to electrically isolate each buried or submerged pipeline from other metallic 
structures as required.  During the inspection, PHMSA observed that the isolation installed 
between the pipeline and the Rincon facility piping was not functioning properly, resulting in a 
resistive short. 

Therefore, DCOR failed to electrically isolate its buried pipeline from the metallic structure at 
the Rincon facility as required pursuant to § 195.575(a). 

8. 

§ 195.589 What corrosion control information do I have to maintain? 

(a)… 
(c) You must maintain a record of each analysis, check, demonstration, 
examination, inspection, investigation, review, survey, and test required by this 
subpart in sufficient detail to demonstrate the adequacy of corrosion control 
measures or that corrosion requiring control measures does not exist. You must 
retain these records for at least 5 years, except that records related to §§ 195.569, 

2 See 49 CFR § 195.452(f)(6). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
195.573(a) and (b), and 195.579(b)(3) and (c) must be retained for as long as the 
pipeline remains in service. 

DCOR failed to maintain a record of each inspection required by subpart H in sufficient detail to 
demonstrate the adequacy of corrosion control measures.  At the time of the PHMSA inspection, 
DCOR was unable to provide a copy of the atmospheric corrosion inspection records for the 
portion of the pipeline on Platform A as required by § 195.583(a). 

Therefore, DCOR failed to maintain records in accordance with § 195.589(c). 

Proposed Civil Penalty 
Under 49 U.S.C. § 60122 and 49 CFR § 190.223, you are subject to a civil penalty not to exceed 
$266,015 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,660,135 for a
