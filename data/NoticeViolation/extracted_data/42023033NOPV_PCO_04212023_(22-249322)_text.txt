Daniel Woods 
VP LNG Operations 
Cove Point LNG, LP 
2100 Cove Point Road 
Lusby, Maryland 20657 

Dear Mr. Woods: 

CPF 4-2023-033-NOPV 

From  August  15  through  September  29,  2022,  a  representative  of  the  Pipeline  and  Hazardous 
Materials  Safety  Administration  (PHMSA),  pursuant  to  Chapter  601  of  49  United  States  Code 
(U.S.C.) inspected the plans, procedures, and records for the Cove Point Liquefied Natural Gas 
(LNG) facility in Lusby, Maryland. 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that Cove Point LNG has committed probable violations 
of  the  Pipeline  Safety  Regulations,  Title  49,  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR).  The  items 
inspected and the probable violations are: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. 

§ 193.2521 Operating records. 
Each operator shall maintain a record of results of each inspection, test 
and investigation required by this subpart. For each LNG facility that 
is  designed and constructed after March  31, 2000,  the  operator shall 
also maintain related inspection, testing, and investigation records that 
NFPA-59A-2001 (incorporated by reference, see § 193.2013) requires. 
Such records, whether required by this part or NFPA-59A-2001, must 
be kept for a period of not less than five years. 

§ 193.2505 Cooldown. 

(a) . . . . 
(b) After cooldown stabilization is reached, cryogenic piping 
systems must be checked for leaks in areas of flanges, valves, and 
seals. 

Cove Point LNG failed to maintain a record of results of each inspection, test and investigation 
required by Subpart F in accordance with § 193.2521.  Specifically,  Cove Point LNG failed to 
maintain inspection records for leak checks carried out following a trip off incident on June 14, 
2022, on the main cryogenic heat exchanger in accordance with § 193.2505 and its procedures. 

Cove  Point  LNG’s  procedure,  SOP-020-01  (Feb.  9,  2022),  requires  completion  of  a  checklist, 
CP0002, Piping/Equipment Cooldown Checklist, to document all cooldown leak checks.  Cove 
Point failed to provide this record documenting a cooldown leak check after the trip off incident 
on June 14, 2022. 

On May 05, 2011, PHMSA warned the operator about its prior failure to complete this form (CPF 
1-2011-3001W). 

Therefore,  Cove  Point  LNG  failed  to  maintain  a  record  of  results  of  each  inspection,  test  and 
investigation required by Subpart F in accordance with § 193.2521. 

2. 

§ 193.2605 Maintenance procedures. 

(a) . . . . 
(b)  Each  operator  shall  follow  one  or  more  manuals  of  written 
procedures  for  the  maintenance  of  each  component,  including  any 
required corrosion control. The procedure must include: 

(1)  The  details  of  the  inspections  or  tests  determined  under 
paragraph (a) of this section and their frequency of performance; and 

Cove Point LNG’s manuals of written procedures for the maintenance of each component failed 
to include the details of the inspections or tests determined under § 193.2605(a) in accordance with 
§ 193.2605(b)(1).  Specifically, Cove Point LNG failed to develop procedures for the inspection 
and testing of high temperature detector sensors and low temperature detector sensors. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
After the inspection, Cove Point LNG developed procedures to provide guidance on the inspection 
and testing of high temperature detector sensors and low temperature detector sensors. 

Therefore,  Cove  Point  LNG’s  manuals  of  written  procedures  for  the  maintenance  of  each 
component failed to include the details of the inspections or tests determined under § 193.2605(a) 
in accordance with § 193.2605(b)(1). 

3. 

§ 193.2637 Remedial measures. 
Prompt  corrective  or  remedial  action  must  be  taken  whenever  an 
operator learns by inspection or otherwise that atmospheric, external, 
or internal corrosion is not controlled as required by this subpart. 

Cove  Point  LNG  failed  to  take  prompt  corrective  or  remedial  action  after  learning  that 
atmospheric,  external,  or  internal  corrosion  is  not  controlled  as  required  by  Subpart  G  in 
accordance  with  §  193.2637  and  its  procedures.1  Specifically,  Cove  Point  LNG  failed  to  take 
prompt remedial or corrective actions at the following locations: 

1.  Cove Point LNG failed to take prompt correction action at T/S 109.  On July 31, 2019, 
Cove  Point  LNG  determined  that  one  pipe  wire  and  two  anodes  required  remediation. 
However, Cove Point LNG did not take corrective action until after the issue was identified 
during the inspection, on September 28, 2022. 

2.  Cove Point LNG failed to take prompt correction action at T/S 30.  On June 16, 2020, Cove 
Point  LNG  discovered  a  low  CP  reading.  However,  Cove  Point  LNG  did  not  take 
corrective action until after the issue was identified during the inspection, on September 
28, 2022. 

3.  Cove  Point  LNG  failed  to  take  prompt  correction  action  at  T/S  11.  Cove  Point  LNG 
recorded low CP readings in 2021 (-0.667 mV) and 2022 (-0.683 mV).  However, Cove 
Point  LNG  did  not  take  corrective  action  until  after  the  issue  was  identified  during  the 
inspection, on September 28, 2022. 

4.  Cove Point LNG failed to take prompt correction action at T/S 117.  Cove Point LNG failed 
to include pipe to soil CP readings in 2021 and 2022.  In addition, this issue was identified 
on a 2019 work order.  However, Cove Point LNG did not take corrective action until after 
the issue was identified during the inspection, on September 28, 2022. 

Therefore, Cove Point LNG failed to take prompt corrective or remedial action after learning that 
atmospheric,  external,  or  internal  corrosion  is  not  controlled  as  required  by  Subpart  G  in 
accordance with § 193.2637. 

1 Cove Point LNG’s procedures state that it must correct identified corrosion control deficiencies within 15 months, 
or before the next inspection, whichever is less. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
 
  
4. 

§ 193.2801 Fire Protection 
Each  operator  must  provide  and  maintain  fire  protection  at  LNG 
plants according to sections 9.1 through 9.7 and section 9.9 of NFPA-
59A-2001 (incorporated by reference, see § 193.2013). However, LNG 
plants existing on March 31, 2000, need not comply with provisions on 
emergency  shutdown  systems,  water  delivery  systems,  detection 
systems, and personnel qualification and training until September 12, 
2005. 

Cove Point LNG failed to maintain fire protection at its LNG facility in accordance with NFPA-
59A-2001 and § 193.2801.  Specifically, Cove Point LNG failed to conduct an adequate evaluation 
to determine the spacing and location of fire detectors in accordance with NFPA-72-1999. 

Section  9.3.4  of  NFPA-59A-2001  states  that  “[t]he  detection  systems  determined  from  the 
evaluation  in  9.1.2  shall  be  designed,  installed,  and  maintained  in  accordance  with  NFPA  72, 
National Fire Alarm Code, or NFPA 1221, Standard for the Installation, Maintenance, and Use of 
Emergency Services Communications Systems, as applicable.”  Section 2-4.3.2.1 of NFPA-72-
1999  states  that  the  location  and  spacing  of  detectors  shall  be  the  result  of  an  engineering 
evaluation that addresses numerous factors.2 

Section 2-4.3.2.2 of NFPA-72-1999 states that the system design shall specify the flaming fire to 
be detected and section 2-4.3.2.3 of NFPA-72-1999 states that “[i]n applications where the fire to 
be detected could occur in an area not on the optical axis of the detector, the distance shall be 
reduced or detectors added to compensate for the angular displacement of the fire in accordance 
with the manufacturer’s documented instructions.” 

On August 14, 2014, Cove Point LNG conducted an evaluation as required by Section 9.1.2 of 
NFPA-59A-2001.  This evaluation determined that an additional UV/IR detector was required to 
provide coverage of the area by the cold gas compressors in 106H building.  However, Cove Point 
LNG failed to install the additional detectors and failed to provide an adequate justification for 
deviating from the evaluation.  On June 9, 2020, Cove Point LNG conducted a new evaluation. 
This evaluation did not recommend installation of additional detectors in the 106H building. 

The 2014 and 2020 evaluations failed to consider each factor listed in section 2-4.3.2.1 of NFPA-
72-1999.  Further, the evaluations did not specify the size of the flaming fire to be detected and 
failed to determine if the fire to be detected could occur in an area not on the optical axis of the 
detector. 

Therefore, Cove Point LNG failed to maintain fire protection at its LNG facility in accordance 
with NFPA-59A-2001 and § 193.2801. 

2 Those factors are:  (1) Size of the fire that is to be detected; (2) Fuel involved; (3) Sensitivity of the detector; (4) 
Field of view of the detector; (5) Distance between the fire and the detector; (6) Radiant energy absorption of the 
atmosphere; (7) Presence of extraneous sources of radiant emissions; (8) Purpose of detection system; and (9) 
Response time required.
