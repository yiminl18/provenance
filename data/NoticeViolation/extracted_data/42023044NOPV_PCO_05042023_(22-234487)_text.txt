Targa Downstream LLC 
811 Louisiana Street Suite 2100 
Houston TX, 77002 

Dear Mr. White: 

CPF 4-2023-044-NOPV 

From February 22 to October 17, 2022, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 
Safety  Administration  (PHMSA),  pursuant  to  Chapter  601  of  49  United  States  Code  (U.S.C.), 
inspected  Targa Downstream, LLC’s (Targa) Grand Prix and Orange NGL pipeline  systems in 
Houston, TX. 

As  a  result  of  the  inspection,  it  is  alleged  that  Targa  has  committed  probable  violations  of  the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The items inspected 
and the probable violations are: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
1. 

§ 195.402 Procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies. 

(a)  General.  Each  operator  shall  prepare  and  follow  for  each 
pipeline system a manual of written procedures for conducting normal 
operations  and  maintenance  activities  and  handling  abnormal 
operations and emergencies. This manual shall be reviewed at intervals 
not  exceeding  15  months,  but  at  least  once  each  calendar  year,  and 
appropriate  changes  made  as  necessary  to  insure  that  the  manual  is 
effective. This manual shall be prepared before initial operations of a 
pipeline  system  commence,  and  appropriate  parts  shall  be  kept  at 
locations where operations and maintenance activities are conducted. 

(c) Maintenance and normal  operations.  The manual  required by 
paragraph (a) of this section must include procedures for the following 
to provide safety during maintenance and normal operations: 

(1) . . . . 
(13) Periodically reviewing the work done by operator personnel to 
determine the effectiveness of the procedures used in normal operation 
and  maintenance  and  taking  corrective  action  where  deficiencies  are 
found. 

Targa  failed  to  follow  its  manual  of  written  procedures  for  conducting  normal  operations  and 
maintenance  activities  and  handling  abnormal  operations  and  emergencies  in  accordance  with 
§ 195.402(a)  and  Targa  failed  to  include  the  procedures  required  by  §  195.402(c)(13).  
Specifically,  Targa  failed  to  conduct  periodic  reviews  of  work  done  by  operator  personnel  to 
determine the effectiveness of the procedures used in normal operation and maintenance and take 
corrective action where deficiencies were found in accordance with § 195.402(c)(13). 

During the inspection, PHMSA requested records associated with periodic reviews of the work 
done by operator personnel for the calendar year 2020, 2021 and 2022.  Targa failed to provide 
records of any periodic reviews. 

Further, Targa’s Hazardous Liquid OM&E – Operations & Maintenance Manual (Aug. 13, 2010) 
failed to include an adequate procedure for periodically reviewing the work done by personnel to 
determine the effectiveness of procedures in accordance with § 195.402(c)(13).  This procedure 
failed to include details on how the work done by operator personnel is reviewed to determine 
effectiveness of procedures, and how the results of the reviews is documented. 

Therefore,  Targa  failed  to  follow  its  manual  of  written  procedures  for  conducting  normal 
operations  and  maintenance  activities  and  handling  abnormal  operations  and  emergencies  in 
accordance with § 195.402(a) & (c)(13). 

2. 

§ 195.452 Pipeline integrity management in high consequence areas. 

(a) . . . . 
(j)  What  is  a  continual  process  of  evaluation  and  assessment  to 

maintain a pipeline's integrity? 

 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1) General. After completing the baseline integrity assessment, an 
operator must continue to assess the line pipe at specified intervals and 
periodically evaluate the integrity of each pipeline segment that could 
affect a high consequence area. 

Targa failed to periodically evaluate the integrity of each pipeline segment that could affect a high 
consequence area (HCA) in accordance with § 195.452(j)(1) and Targa failed to have and follow 
procedures implementing § 195.452(j)(1) in accordance with § 195.402(c)(3).  Specifically, Targa 
failed  to  conduct  a  periodic  evaluation  for  the  Davis  pump  station  in  Murray  County,  OK  and 
failed to provide a process in its integrity management plan to periodically evaluate the integrity 
of each pipeline segment that could affect an HCA. 

During the inspection, Targa failed to provide records of a periodic evaluation for the Davis pump 
station in Murray County, OK.  Targa provided a spreadsheet for the Akoma to Velma segment 
but  it  failed  to  address  specific  risk  factors  and  analysis  for  this  facility.  The  record  failed  to 
demonstrate that a periodic evaluation was performed to address the risk associated with the Davis 
pump facility, which is in an HCA. 

Targa’s Integrity Management Plan for Liquids Transmission Pipelines Section 7.1 (Apr. 1, 2020) 
failed to include provisions for periodic evaluations of each pipeline segment that could affect an 
HCA.  Rather, this section only included the assessment process for line pipe at specified intervals. 
The procedure failed to provide details on how the periodic evaluation would be conducted for 
pump station facility. 

Therefore, Targa failed to periodically evaluate the integrity of each pipeline segment that could 
affect a high consequence area (HCA) in accordance with § 195.452(j)(1) and Targa failed to have 
and follow procedures implementing § 195.452(j)(1) in accordance with § 195.402(c)(3).

PROPOSED COMPLIANCE ORDER 

Pursuant  to  49  United  States  Code  §  60118,  the  Pipeline  and  Hazardous  Materials  Safety 
Administration  (PHMSA)  proposes to  issue  to Targa  Downstream, LLC (Targa)  a Compliance 
Order incorporating the following remedial requirements to ensure the compliance of Targa with 
the pipeline safety regulations: 

A. 

B. 

C. 

In regard to Item 1 of the Notice pertaining to Targa’s failure to conduct periodic 
reviews of work done by operator personnel to determine the effectiveness of the 
procedures used in normal operation and maintenance, and take corrective action 
where deficiencies were found and failure to establish a proper procedure for the 
same,  Targa  must  amend  its  procedures  to  include  provisions  for  periodically 
reviewing the work done by operator personnel to determine the effectiveness of 
the  procedures  used  in  normal  operation  and  maintenance  and  taking  corrective 
action where deficiencies are found within 30 days of issuance of the Final Order. 

In  regard  to  Item  2  of  the  Notice  pertaining  to  Targa’s  failure  to  periodically 
evaluate the integrity of each pipeline segment that could affect a high consequence 
area,  Targa  must  develop  a  procedure  in  its  integrity  management  plan  to 
periodically evaluate the integrity of each pipeline segment that could affect a high 
consequence  area  within  30  days  of  issuance  of  the  Final  Order.  Targa  must 
perform  the  periodic  evaluation  of  Davis  pump  station  facility  and  submit  the 
evaluation to the Director, Southwest Region within 60 days of issuance of the Final 
Order. 

It  is  requested  (not  mandated)  that  Targa  maintain  documentation  of  the  safety 
improvement costs associated with fulfilling this Compliance Order and submit the 
total  to  Bryan  Lethcoe,  Director,  Southwest  Region,  Pipeline  and  Hazardous 
Materials Safety Administration.  It is requested that these costs be reported in two 
categories: 1) total cost associated with preparation/revision of plans, procedures, 
studies and analyses, and 2) total cost associated with replacements, additions and 
other changes to pipeline infrastructure.
