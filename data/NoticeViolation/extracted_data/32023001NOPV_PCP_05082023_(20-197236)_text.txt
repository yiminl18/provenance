Dear Mr. Milford: 

CPF 3-2023-001-NOPV 

From December 4, 2020, through August 13, 2021, a representative of the Pipeline and 
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), pursuant 
to Chapter 601 of 49 United States Code (U.S.C.), investigated a spill on Magellan Midstream 
Partners, L.P.’s (Magellan) 6-inch nominal diameter hazardous liquid pipeline system in 
Commerce City, Colorado, a suburb of Denver.  The rupture of the pipeline on December 4, 
2020, resulted in the release of a reported 487 barrels of diesel fuel in a high consequence area 
(HCA). 

The 6-inch pipeline originates from Magellan’s Commerce City pump station at the Suncor 
Energy Refinery and transports refined products to a terminal near Fountain, Colorado.  At the 
time of the spill the pipeline was delivering product to the Fountain Terminal when the pipe 
ruptured at 5:16 a.m. Mountain Standard Time (MST) at Milepost 0.17 along 56th Avenue, less 
than 1,000 feet from the Commerce City pump station discharge.  The pipeline was controlled 
and monitored remotely by Magellan personnel using a Supervisory Control and Data 
Acquisition (SCADA) system. 

Upon occurrence of the pipeline rupture, the SCADA system indicated pressure and flow 
deviations in the Magellan control center, and the pipeline was shutdown (First Shutdown) at 

 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
5:17 am MST.  The operational deviations indicated by SCADA included decreasing pressure 
along with an increasing flow rate at the Commerce City pump station. 

Twenty-two (22) minutes after the First Shutdown, at approximately 5:39 am MST, the pipeline 
was restarted (Restart) by the Magellan control center, and flow resumed from Commerce City.  
Pumping from the Commerce City pump station continued for approximately seven (7) minutes 
until the pump was shutdown at approximately 5:46 am MST (Second Shutdown). 

Fifty-five (55) minutes after the Second Shutdown, at approximately 6:42 am MST, an 
emergency was announced in the control room, initiating Magellan’s response plans.  The total 
elapsed time from the First Shutdown until the control room announcement of an emergency on 
the pipeline was approximately 1 hour and 25 minutes. The National Response Center was called 
at approximately 7:08 am MST, 1 hour and 52 minutes after the First Shutdown occurred. 

The origin of the rupture was a 6-inch-long split in the long seam of the pipe.  The failed pipe 
was removed and sent for metallurgical analysis where the apparent cause of the rupture was 
determined to be selective seam weld corrosion. 

As a result of the investigation, it is alleged that Magellan has committed probable violations of 
the Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The items 
investigated and the probable violations are: 

1. 

§ 195.401  General requirements. 
(a)  No operator may operate or maintain its pipeline systems at a level of safety 
lower than that required by this subpart and the procedures it is required to 
establish under § 195.402(a) of this subpart. 

On December 4, 2020, Magellan operated the 6-inch Commerce City to Fountain Terminal 
pipeline at a level of safety lower than required by part 195 subpart F – Operation & 
Maintenance when the pipeline was re-started (Restart) after the First Shutdown and ran for 
approximately seven minutes while discharging diesel fuel into a high consequence area through 
a rupture in the pipe.  Logs of the flow rate at Commerce City showed the flow averaged 763 
barrels per hour during the 7 minutes of operation after the Restart.  Operating the pipeline from 
the time of the Restart (5:39 a.m. MST) until the Second Shutdown (5:46 a.m. MST) was also 
not in accordance with Magellan procedures. 

Just prior to the rupture, the pipeline had been operating in steady state with 1,330 psi discharge 
pressure at Commerce City.  After the Restart began at 5:39 am MST, the discharge pressure at 
Commerce City briefly reached a high of only 146 psi, as shown in a log of recorded pressures. 
This available information in Magellan’s control room indicated that the pipeline was not safe 
for continued operation after the Restart. 

To provide for a controller’s prompt and appropriate response to operating conditions, the 
control room management regulations of § 195.446(b) require definition of a controller’s 
authority and responsibility to make decisions, take actions, and communicate with others.  
These responsibilities and authority were mentioned in Magellan’s procedures (e.g., Normal 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Operations and Line Monitoring Procedure 9.02-ADM-017) for monitoring and responding to 
pipeline conditions, including the authority to take actions such as shutdown and isolation of 
pipelines, or delaying startup of pipelines under their control.  Restarting and continuing to run 
the pipeline for seven minutes after it had ruptured was not an appropriate response to the 
SCADA-indicated abnormal operating conditions. 

As denoted in the written 30-day report (Form PHMSA F 7000.1), Magellan initiated an 
investigation into whether the controller(s) or control room issues were the cause of, or a 
contributing factor, to the accident.  Magellan determined that the SCADA and CPM 
(computational pipeline monitoring) systems were operating and fully functional, and their 
investigation identified that “incorrect controller action or controller error” had occurred. 

2. 

§ 195.402  Procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies. 
(a)  General.  Each operator shall prepare and follow for each pipeline system a 
manual of written procedures for conducting normal operations and maintenance 
activities and handling abnormal operations and emergencies. 

Magellan did not follow its procedures for handling abnormal operations when it failed to 
investigate and correct the cause of abnormal operation between the time of the First Shutdown 
at 05:17 am MST and prior to the Restart at 05:39 am MST.  Section 195.402(d)(1) requires 
responding to, investigating, and correcting the cause of an increase or decrease in pressure or 
flow outside normal operating limits.  Section 195.402(d)(2) requires checking variations from 
normal operation after an abnormal operation at sufficient critical locations in the system to 
determine continued integrity and safe operation. 

According to logs of pressure and flow, prior to the time of the rupture at 5:16 a.m., the pipeline 
was running in a steady state mode with the Commerce City discharge pressure consistently at 
1,330 psi while the flow was approximately 843 barrels per hour.  At the time of the failure, the 
SCADA system showed a sharp drop in pressure and a sudden increase in flow rate at the 
Commerce City pump station, indicating a rupture had occurred. 

Magellan failed to follow its Startup and Shutdown Procedure 9.02-ADM-002, which required a 
review of static line conditions for pipeline integrity prior to restarting the line.  The procedure 
further stated that if the static line pressure was not above minimum pressures, then a pressure 
test was necessary.  After the First Shutdown, the Commerce City discharge pressure fell to less 
than 20 psi while the suction pressure at the Russellville pump station downstream was 0 psi. 
These low pressures, recorded between the First Shutdown and the Restart, were further 
indications of a failed pipeline that did not have continued integrity for safe operation. 

After the First Shutdown at 5:17 am, the Magellan control room contacted the refinery to 
ascertain if the supply of diesel fuel to Magellan’s pump station had been interrupted.  After the 
refinery reported back to Magellan that there were no issues in the refinery at 5:37 am MST, the 
Commerce City pump station was started (Restart) by Magellan two minutes later at 5:39 am.  
Despite this, the Magellan control room staff did not conclude there was an issue (i.e., a pipe 
rupture) on the 6-inch pipeline, as indicated in the SCADA operating data.  It was not until 5:48 
am MST, after the Second Shutdown at 5:46, that control room staff contacted a local field 

 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
technician to investigate further at the Commerce City pump station.  As such, the cause of the 
abnormal operation was not adequately investigated by Magellan, and was not corrected between 
the time of the First Shutdown and the Restart. 

3. 

§ 195.402  Procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies. 
(a) General.  Each operator shall prepare and follow for each pipeline system a 
manual of written procedures for conducting normal operations and maintenance 
activities and handling abnormal operations and emergencies. 

Magellan did not follow its procedures for handling emergencies when it failed to initiate its 
Code Red Event Procedure 9.02-ADM-011 for approximately 1 hour and 25 minutes after the 
First Shutdown at 5:17 am MST.  Code Red is a term Magellan used for an emergency, including 
SCADA-indicated pipeline ruptures, and notifications reporting a pipeline fire, or explosion, etc. 
The Code Red was initiated from the control room at 6:42 am MST. 

Section 195.402(e) requires procedures to provide safety when an emergency condition occurs, 
including a prompt and effective response to an accidental release of hazardous liquid from a 
pipeline [see § 195.402(e)(2)].  In Magellan’s Code Red Event Procedure 9.02-ADM-011, the 
controller of the console experiencing the emergency event had the role of initiating the 
procedure, and was to immediately announce “Code Red” within the control room.  Other 
immediate actions included emergency shutdown of the pipeline and closure of valves. 

Per the written 30-day report (Form PHMSA F 7000.1) submitted by Magellan, “CPM leak 
detection system or SCADA-based information (such as alarm(s), alert(s), event(s), and/or 
volume calculations)” was how the pipeline accident was identified.  At multiple times on the 
morning of December 4, 2020, sufficient information was available in Magellan’s control room 
to initiate a Code Red emergency.  The pipe failure at 5:16 am MST exhibited characteristics of a 
rupture in the SCADA system, including a sudden loss of pressure accompanied by increased 
flow rate.  At 5:43 am MST it was observed in the control room that pressures and flows were 
not rising after the Restart. After the Second Shutdown at 5:46 am MST, pressures at Commerce 
City dropped again.  At 6:19 am MST, the refinery contacted the Magellan control room and 
reported a possible leak on Magellan’s pipeline.  At 6:32 am MST, the refinery called the 
Magellan control room to report that spilled product was located at the fence line with diesel fuel 
on the road at 56th Avenue.  At 6:40 am MST a Magellan technician called the control room to 
report that the spill was from Magellan’s pipeline, and the controller initiated the Code Red 
Event procedure at 6:42 am MST.  In summary, Magellan did not initiate an emergency response 
promptly in accordance with its Code Red Event procedure.
