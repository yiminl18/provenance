Greg McIlwain 
Executive Vice President, Operations 
Energy Transfer Company 
1300 Main Street 
Houston, Texas 77002 

Dear Mr. McIlwain: 

CPF 4-2023-034-NOPV 

From June 6 through December 1, 2022, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 
Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 
United States Code (U.S.C.) inspected Energy Transfer Company’s Mid-Valley Pipeline Company 
(ETC Mid-Valley) in Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky,  Tennessee,  Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, 
and Texas. 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that ETC Mid-Valley  has committed probable violations 
of  the  Pipeline  Safety  Regulations,  Title  49,  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR).  The  items 
inspected and the probable violations are: 

1. 

§ 195.52 Immediate notice of certain accidents. 

(a)  Notice  requirements.  At  the  earliest  practicable  moment 
following  discovery,  of  a  release  of  the  hazardous  liquid  or  carbon 
dioxide transported resulting in an event described in § 195.50, but no 
later  than  one  hour  after  confirmed  discovery,  the  operator  of  the 
system  must  give  notice,  in  accordance  with  paragraph  (b)  of  this 
section of any failure that: 

(1) . . . . 
(3) Caused estimated property damage, including cost of cleanup 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and recovery, value of lost product, and damage to the property of 

the operator or others, or both, exceeding $50,000 

ETC Mid-Valley failed to give notice, at the earliest practicable moment but no later than one hour 
after confirmed discovery, following discovery of a release of a hazardous liquid resulting in an 
event where an estimated property damage, including cost of cleanup and recovery, value of lost 
product, and damage to property of the operator or others, or both, exceeded $50,000 in accordance 
with § 195.52(a)(3).  Specifically, PHMSA found three occasions in 2021 and 2022 when ETC 
Mid-Valley  experienced  reportable  accidents  but  failed  to  give  notice  within  the  required  time 
frame to the National Response Center. 

On February 22, 2021, ETC Mid-Valley identified a reportable accident due to estimated property 
damage of $81,512.  However, ETC Mid-Valley did not notify NRC until March 12, 2021.  On 
June 10, 2021, ETC Mid-Valley identified a reportable accident due to estimated property damage 
of $79,229.  However, ETC Mid-Valley did not notify NRC until June 11, 2021.  On June 29, 
2022,  at  1234  local  time,  ETC  Mid-Valley  identified  a  reportable  accident  due  to  estimated 
property damage of $4,651,397.  However, ETC Mid-Valley did not notify NRC until June 29, 
2022 at 1615 local time. 

Therefore, ETC Mid-Valley failed to give notice, at the earliest practicable moment but no later 
than one hour after confirmed discovery, following discovery of a release of a hazardous liquid 
resulting in an event where an estimated property damage, including cost of cleanup and recovery, 
value of lost product, and damage to property of the operator or others, or both, exceeded $50,000 
in accordance with § 195.52(a)(3). 

2. 

§ 195.412 Inspection of rights-of-way and crossings under navigable waters. 
(a) Each operator shall, at intervals not exceeding 3 weeks, but at 
least 26 times each calendar year, inspect the surface conditions on or 
adjacent to each pipeline right-of-way. Methods of inspection include 
walking, driving, flying or other appropriate means of traversing the 
right-of-way. 

ETC Mid-Valley failed to inspect the surface conditions on or adjacent to each pipeline right-of-
way (ROW) using an appropriate method of inspection in accordance with § 195.412(a). 

During the inspection, PHMSA noted several locations along the pipeline where the ROW was 
overgrown with vegetation, or the overhang of tree branches made it difficult to adequately inspect 
the ROW by aerial patrols.  PHMSA noted seven locations in four units where surface or overhead 
conditions did not allow for adequate aerial patrols.  ETC Mid-Valley failed to provide records of 
ground patrols for these locations. 

The following ROWs had overhanging trees and/or overgrown vegetation that prevented a clear 
inspection of the ROW from an aerial patrol: 

1) ROW at BV 55 southwest of Dixie, LA (Unit ID 9754, TX (Longview)) 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
2) ROW at MP 294 southwest of Minter City, MS, and MP 388 southeast of Holly 

Springs, MS (Unit ID 1922, MS, TN (Oxford)) 

3) ROW at BV 626 east of Morgantown, KY and in the Fox Crossing subdivision 

in Clarksville, TN (Unit ID 84893, TN, KY (Oxford)) 

4) BV 549 northwest of Palmyra, TN, and the ROW at BV 772 southeast of Patriot, 

IN (Unit ID 1932, KY) 

Therefore, ETC Mid-Valley failed to inspect the surface conditions on or adjacent to each pipeline 
right-of-way using an appropriate method of inspection in accordance with § 195.412(a). 

3. 

§ 195.420 Valve maintenance. 

(a) Each operator shall maintain each valve that is necessary for the 
safe operation of its pipeline systems in good working order at all times. 

ETC Mid-Valley failed to maintain each valve that is necessary for the safe operation of its pipeline 
systems in good working order at all times in accordance with § 195.420(a).  Specifically, PHMSA 
found two leaking valves and a remote operated valve (ROV) that did not respond to open or close 
signals from the control room. 

During  the  inspection  PHMSA  observed  a  leaking  valve  downstream  from  MOV  4191  at  the 
Toledo Terminal Station, identified as Valve #15 and a leaking discharge valve from pump unit 
#4 at the Lima Pump Station.  The ROV, BV 400, experienced a communications failure during 
operation of the valve for the field inspection.  The valve did not respond to open or close signals 
from the control room, but could be manually operated. 

Therefore, ETC Mid-Valley failed to maintain each valve that is necessary for the safe operation 
of its pipeline systems in good working order at all times in accordance with § 195.420(a). 

4. 

§ 195.432 Inspection of in-service breakout tanks. 

(a) . . . . 
(b) Each operator must inspect the physical integrity of in-service 
atmospheric  and  low-pressure  steel  above-ground  breakout  tanks 
according  to  API  Std  653  (except  section  6.4.3,  Alternative  Internal 
Inspection Interval) (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3). However, 
if structural conditions prevent access to the tank bottom, its integrity 
may  be  assessed  according  to  a  plan  included  in  the  operations  and 
maintenance  manual  under  §  195.402(c)(3).  The  risk-based  internal 
inspection procedures in API Std 653, section 6.4.3 cannot be used to 
determine the internal inspection interval. 

ETC  Mid-Valley  failed  to  inspect  the  physical  integrity  of  its  in-service  atmospheric  breakout 
tanks in accordance with § 195.432(b) and failed to follow its manual of written procedures for 
conducting  normal  operations  and  maintenance  activities  in  accordance  with  §  195.402(a). 
Specifically, ETC Mid-Valley failed to conduct monthly in-service visual inspections on several 
breakout tanks (BOTs) in the Hebron and Oxford areas. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Standard Operating Procedure HLT.05 Inspection of In-Service Breakout Tanks Procedure, dated 
10/15/2021,  Section  7.1  requires  monthly  in-service  visual  inspections  on  all  above  ground 
atmospheric and low pressure breakout tanks (BOTs). PHMSA reviewed records for the Hebron 
and Oxford areas and found the following eleven instances of missed monthly inspections: 

Hebron Area: 

•  BOT 1 – missed June 2021 
•  BOT 2 – missed August 2021 
•  BOT 87 – missed September 2021 
•  BOT 91 – missed July 2021 
•  BOT 113 – missed March 2021 

Oxford Area: 

•  BOT 3 – missed July 2021 and October 2021 
•  BOT 7 – missed October 2021, January 2022, March 2022, and July 2022 

Therefore, ETC Mid-Valley failed to inspect the physical integrity of its in-service atmospheric 
breakout  tanks  in  accordance  with  §  195.432(b)  and  failed  to  follow  its  manual  of  written 
procedures  for  conducting  normal  operations  and  maintenance  activities  in  accordance  with  § 
195.402(a). 

5. 

§ 195.505 Qualification program. 

Each  operator  shall  have  and  follow  a  written  qualification 

program. The program shall include provisions to: 

(a) . . . . 
(i) After  December  16,  2004,  notify  the  Administrator  or  a  state 
agency  participating  under  49  U.S.C.  Chapter  601  if  the  operator 
significantly  modifies  the  program  after  the  administrator  or  state 
agency has verified that it complies with this section. Notifications to

ETC Mid-Valley failed to notify the Administrator after it made significant modifications to its 
Operator Qualification (OQ) Program in accordance with § 195.505(i) and its Standard Operating 
Procedure HLA.18 Operator Qualification Plan, dated 12/15/2021.  Specifically, ETC Mid-Valley 
failed to timely notify PHMSA of three significant modifications to its OQ Program. 

SOP  HLA.18  Section  7.11  Notification  to  PHMSA  and  State  Agencies  states  that  significant 
changes, such as a change in the number of covered tasks identified by the operator and changes 
in span of control, will be reported to PHMSA. 
PHMSA  reviewed  the  HLA.18  Operator  Qualification  Plan  Revision  Log,  dated  10/21/2021 
which stated ETC Mid-Valley changed the number of covered tasks identified on May 4, 2018, 
but did not notify PHMSA until October 28, 2020, a delay of over two years.  ETC Mid-Valley 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
made additional changes to the number of covered tasks on March 24, 2021 and notified PHMSA 
on April 12, 2021.  ETC Mid-Valley made changes to span of control for several covered tasks on 
August 11, 2021 and added additional covered tasks on October 21, 2021.  ETC Mid-Valley has 
not notified PHMSA of the changes made in August and October 2021. 

Therefore,  ETC  Mid-Valley  failed  to  notify  the  Administrator  after  it  made  significant 
modifications to its OQ Program in accordance with § 195.505(i) and its procedures. 

6. 

§ 195.581 Which pipelines must I protect against atmospheric corrosion and 
what coating material may I use? 

(a) You must clean and coat each pipeline or portion of pipeline that 
is exposed to the atmosphere, except pipelines under paragraph (c) of 
this section. 

ETC Mid-Valley failed to protect aboveground pipe from atmospheric corrosion by cleaning and 
coating each pipeline or portion of pipeline that is exposed to the atmosphere in accordance with 
§  195.581(a).  Specifically,  PHMSA  observed  three  locations  where  coating  material  had 
deteriorated and showed bare pipe at the soil-to-air interfaces.  PHMSA observed bare pipe at the 
Toledo Terminal Station, the Denver Station, and at BV 220. 

Therefore, ETC Mid-Valley  failed to  protect  aboveground pipe  from atmospheric corrosion  by 
cleaning  and  coating  each  pipeline  or  portion  of  pipeline  that  is  exposed  to  the  atmosphere  in 
accordance with § 195.581(a). 

7. 

§ 195.583 What must I do to monitor atmospheric corrosion control? 

(a)  You  must  inspect  each  pipeline  or  portion  of  pipeline  that  is 
exposed  to  the  atmosphere  for  evidence  of  atmospheric  corrosion,  as 
follows: 

ETC Mid-Valley failed to inspect each pipeline or portion of its pipeline that is exposed to the 
atmosphere for evidence of atmospheric corrosion at least once every 3 calendar years, but with 
intervals not exceeding 39 months for its onshore Mid-Valley Pipeline System in accordance with 
§ 195.583(a). 

PHMSA inspected records for the Delhi, LA location and found that ETC Mid-Valley failed to 
conduct atmospheric corrosion inspections at least once every three calendar years with intervals 
not  to  exceed  39  months.  ETC Mid-Valley conducted atmospheric corrosion inspections  from 
May 1 through June 2, 2015 but not again until December 9 through December 10, 2020. 

If the pipeline is located:Then the frequency of inspection is:OnshoreAt least once every 3 calendar years, but with intervals not exceeding 39 months.OffshoreAt least once each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 15 months. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Therefore, ETC Mid-Valley failed to inspect each pipeline or portion of pipeline that is exposed 
to the atmosphere for evidence of atmospheric corrosion at least once every 3 calendar years, but 
with intervals not exceeding 39 months, in accordance with § 195.583(a).
