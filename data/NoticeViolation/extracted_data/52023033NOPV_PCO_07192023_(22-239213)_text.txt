NOTICE OF PROBABLE VIOLATION 
and 
PROPOSED COMPLIANCE ORDER 

VIA ELECTRONIC MAIL TO MR. JOHN HILL: 

July 19, 2023 

Mr. John Hill 
VP of Natural Gas System Safety 
Black Hills Energy 
7001 Mt. Rushmore Road 
PO Box 1400 
Rapid City, SD 57709 

Dear Mr. Hill: 

CPF 5-2023-033-NOPV 

From April 25 through 29, 2022, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety 
Administration (PHMSA), pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 United States Code, inspected Black 
Hills Shoshone Pipeline, LLC (Black Hills) procedures for control room management in Council 
Bluffs, Iowa. 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that you have committed probable violations of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The items inspected 
and the probable violations are: 

1. 

§ 192.631  Control room management. 

(a)  … 
(c)  Provide adequate information. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
Each operator must provide its controllers with the information, tools, processes 
and procedures necessary for the controllers to carry out the roles and 
responsibilities the operator has defined by performing each of the following: 
(1) Implement sections 1, 4, 8, 9, 11.1, and 11.3 of API RP 1165 (incorporated by 
reference, see § 192.7) whenever a SCADA system is added, expanded or replaced, 
unless the operator demonstrates that certain provisions of sections 1, 4, 8, 9, 11.1, 
and 11.3 of API RP 1165 are not practical for the SCADA system used; … 

Black Hills failed to implement the required sections of API RP 1165 set forth in § 192.631(c)(1) 
and/or failed to demonstrate that certain provisions of those sections are not practical for the 
SCADA system used.  During the inspection, Black Hills was unable to present records to 
establish that the SCADA systems were compliant with API RP 11651.  Black Hills began 
pipeline control room operations at the Council Bluffs, Iowa facility in July 2020.  Prior to 
beginning control room operations to Council Bluffs, Black Hills operated two control rooms in 
Omaha, Nebraska.  Black Hills operates two SCADA systems from the control room in Council 
Bluffs, Iowa, the legacy Source Gas system commissioned in 2016 and the legacy Black Hills 
system commissioned prior to 2009.  The relocation and consolidation of multiple control rooms 
to a new facility required an analysis of the new facilities to determine if the new facilities were 
additions, expansions or replacements of a SCADA system under § 192.631(c)(1). 

2. 

§ 192.631   Control room management. 

(a)  … 
(c)  Provide adequate information.  Each operator must provide its controllers with 
the information, tools, processes and procedures necessary for the controllers to 
carry out the roles and responsibilities the operator has defined by performing each 
of the following: 
(1) … 
(4)  Test any backup SCADA systems at least once each calendar year, but at 
intervals not to exceed 15 months; … 

Black Hills failed to complete the required test of any backup SCADA systems at least once each 
calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15 months.  Black Hills was unable to present the 
test records for 2020 & 2021. 

3. 

§ 192.631  Control room management. 

(a) … 
(h)  Training. Each operator must establish a controller training program and 
review the training program content to identify potential improvements at least 
once each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15 months. An operator's 
program must provide for training each controller to carry out the roles and 

1 See 49 C.F.R. § 192.631(j)(1) (requiring operators to maintain for review during inspection records that 
demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this section). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
responsibilities defined by the operator. In addition, the training program must 
include the following elements: … 

In 2021, Black Hills failed to complete the required training program review of the training 
program content to identify potential improvements at least once each calendar year, but at 
intervals not to exceed 15 months.  The training program was reviewed in 2019 and 2020 at the 
required intervals, but not in 2021. 

4. 

§ 192.631  Control room management. 

(a) … 
(j)  Compliance and deviations.  An operator must maintain for review during 
inspection: 
(1)  Records that demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this section; … 

Black Hills failed to present records to demonstrate a point-to-point verification after annual 
maintenance activities, like-for-like replacements and calibrations of field instrumentation, valve 
operations and other field initiated activities that affect control room operations2. 

Additionally, Black Hills failed to maintain records documenting on-the-job training provided to 
controllers by Black Hills staff.  In practice Black Hills has developed and implemented a new 
controller training program that is more in depth with computer based training, reading of 
individual system description manuals, 1to1 training on the console and exams.

Shoshone Pipeline, LLC (Black Hills) with the pipeline safety regulations: 

A. 

B. 

C. 

D. 

In regard to Item 1 of the Notice, Black Hills must conduct and document an 
evaluation of each SCADA system operated under Black Hills Corporation 
Operations & Maintenance Procedure 135 for compliance with the requisite 
sections of API RP 1165 within 30 days of receipt of the Final Order.  Black Hills

required test of any backup SCADA systems within 30 days of receipt of the Final 
Order. 

In regard to Item 4 of the Notice, Black Hills must amend its Operations and
Maintenance procedures to require point to point verifications for all field
initiated activities that affect control room operations within 30 days of receipt of 
the Final Order.  Black Hills must conduct a forensic analysis of all field
