Dear Ms. Richman: 

CPF 1-2023-008-NOPV 

From  June  1  to  2,  2022,  a  representative  of  the  Pipeline  and  Hazardous  Materials  Safety 
Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 United 
States  Code  (U.S.C.)  inspected  Adelphia  Gateway,  LLC’s  (Adelphia)  pipeline  project  in 
Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. 

As a result of the  inspection,  it is  alleged  that you have  committed  a  probable  violation  of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The item inspected  and 
the probable violation is: 

1. 

§ 192.707 Line markers for mains and transmission lines. 

(a) … 
(c)  Pipelines  aboveground.  Line  markers  must  be  placed  and 
maintained along each section of a main and transmission line that is 
located aboveground in an area accessible to the public. 

Adelphia  failed  to  place  line  markers  along  sections  of  transmission  line  facilities  located 
aboveground in an area accessible to the public.  Specifically, Adelphia failed to place line markers 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
noting the required content, including warnings, name of operator and contact telephone number 
at the Perkiomen main line valve (MLV) site and the East Perkiomen MLV site locations, which 
are located on Adelphia’s 18-inch diameter southern portion mainline. 

During  its  June  1,  2022,  inspection  PHMSA  observed  the  lack  of  line  markers  placed  at  the 
aboveground Perkiomen and East Perkiomen MLV sites.  The Perkiomen MLV is located within 
a High Consequence Area (HCA) adjacent to a children’s playground and public picnic area.  Note, 
Adelphia’s 18-inch diameter southern portion mainline was commissioned on March 31, 2022. 

Therefore, Adelphia failed to meet the requirements of §192.707(c). 

Proposed Civil Penalty

31,  2019  and  before  January  11,  2021,  the  maximum  penalty  may  not  exceed  $218,647  per 
violation  per  day the  violation  persists,  up to  a  maximum  of  $2,186,465  for  a  related  series  of
