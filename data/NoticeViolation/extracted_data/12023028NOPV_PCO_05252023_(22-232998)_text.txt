NOTICE OF PROBABLE VIOLATION 
and 
PROPOSED COMPLIANCE ORDER 

OVERNIGHT EXPRESS DELIVERY 

May 25, 2023 

Mr. Paul Ruppert 
President and Chief Executive Officer 
Eastern Gas Transmission and Storage, Inc. 
6603 West Broad Street 
Richmond, Virginia 23200 

Dear Mr. Ruppert: 

CPF 1-2023-028-NOPV 

From September 7 – November 10, 2022, representatives of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 
Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS),  pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 
United  States  Code  (U.S.C.)  conducted  onsite  inspections  of  Eastern  Gas  Transmission  and 
Storage, Inc’s (EGT&S) procedures, records, and pipeline facilities in and around Luthersburg, 
Pennsylvania. 

As  a  result  of  the  inspection,  it  is  alleged  that  you  have  committed  probable  violations  of  the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The items inspected 
and the probable violations are: 

1. 

§ 192.167 Compressor stations: Emergency shutdown. 

(a) Except  for  unattended  field  compressor  stations  of  1,000 
horsepower (746 kilowatts) or less, each compressor station must have 
an emergency shutdown system that meets the following: 

(4) It must be operable from at least two locations, each of which is: 
(i) Outside the gas area of the station; 
(ii) Near the exit gates, if the station is fenced, or near emergency 

exits, if not fenced; and 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(iii) Not  more  than  500  feet  (153  meters)  from  the  limits  of  the 

station. 

EGT&S failed to have an emergency shutdown system that is operable from at least two locations 
that are near exit gates for a fenced compressor station. 

EGT&S’ South Bend compressor station is an attended compressor station that is fenced and does 
not have at least two emergency shutdown system trigger valves that are near the exit gates.  There 
are no emergency shutdown triggers located near an exit gate at this facility. 

On  October  20,  2022,  the  PHMSA  inspector  conducted  field  observations  at  the  South  Bend 
compressor station and noted the locations of the emergency shutdown system trigger valves.  The 
PHMSA inspector did not observe any emergency shutdown system trigger valves at the fence line 
or near the man gates at the fence.  In post-inspection communication with EGT&S, the PHMSA 
inspector requested documentation of the emergency shutdown system trigger valve locations at 
the South Bend compressor station.  EGT&S provided a Google Earth screenshot with annotations 
indicating  the  locations  of  the  trigger  valves  and  the  closest  exit  gates  on  the  fence  line.  The 
documentation confirmed that there were no emergency shutdown system trigger valves near the 
exit gates. 

Therefore, EGT&S failed to have an emergency shutdown system that was operable from at least 
two locations near exit gates at its South Bend compressor station pursuant to § 192.167(a)(4)(ii).
