NOTICE OF PROBABLE VIOLATION 
and 
PROPOSED CIVIL PENALTY 

VIA ELECTRONIC MAIL TO: alimmer@harvestmidstream.com

Mr. Andrew Limmer 
Vice President 
Harvest Alaska, LLC 
3800 Centerpoint Dr., Suite 1000 
Anchorage, AK 99503 

Dear Mr. Limmer: 

CPF 5-2023-008-NOPV 

Between July 25 and July 29, 2022, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 
Safety Administration (PHMSA), pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 United States Code (U.S.C.), 
inspected your Northstar Gas Transmission Pipeline in Anchorage, Alaska. 

As a result of this inspection, it is alleged that you have committed probable violations of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The items inspected 
and the probable violations are: 

1. 

§ 192.605  Procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies. 

(a)  . . . . 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
(c)  Abnormal operation.  For transmission lines, the manual required by paragraph 
of this section must include procedures for the following to provide safety when 
operating design limits have been exceeded: 
(1) Responding to, investigating, and correcting the cause of: 
(i)  . . . . 
(iii)  Loss of communications; 

Harvest Alaska, LLC (Harvest) failed to provide a record documenting that an abnormal 
operating condition (AOC) had occurred after a loss of communications was discovered.  During 
the PHMSA records inspection, it was discovered that Harvest failed to record an AOC after one 
of its employees discovered the position switch for shutdown valve (SDV), SDV-9420 was not 
accurately communicating with the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system on 
June 5, 2022.  On the Valve Inspection and Maintenance form dated June 5, 2022, Exhibit B-1, 
the employee described the condition as "Valve functions properly. When opening, the valve 
never gave control room an open status.  Had IE-Tech come out and adjust it".  The discovery 
that the remote monitoring unit was not communicating the valve’s accurate position to the 
SCADA system constituted a loss of communications; therefore, an AOC should have been 
initiated until the issue was resolved. 

On June 5, 2022, during Harvest’s routine valve maintenance inspection of valve SDV-9420, the 
SCADA operator attempted to operate the valve remotely from the closed to the open position.  
After the valve was commanded open, the SCADA operator never received a confirmation 
notification indicating the valve was in the open position. Harvest field personnel stated that the 
valve itself operated correctly with full close-to-open travel. It appears the valve’s switch 
indication to the SCADA system did not accurately report the correct travel of the valve, which 
required adjustment by a qualified individual. The adjustment and return-to-service was 
completed by the electrical technician immediately after discovery, and the valve was retested 
satisfactorily. 

2. 

§ 192.805  Qualification program. 

Each operator shall have and follow a written qualification program. The program 
shall include provisions to: 
(a)  . . . . 
(b)  Ensure through evaluation that individuals performing covered tasks are 
qualified; 

A Harvest contractor completed a valve inspection of shutdown valve SDV-9420 on August 26, 
2020 prior to being qualified to complete this task.  Review of Operator Qualification (OQ) 
records demonstrated the individual was not currently qualified to complete the covered task of 
“Inspect, Maintain, and Operate Valves.” 

The NorthStar DOT Valve Inspection Report dated August 26, 2020 for valve SDV-9420 is 
Exhibit A-1, and an image of the Harvest contractor’s OQ records is Exhibit A-2.  The NorthStar 
DOT Valve Inspection Report documented the valve inspection that occurred on August 26, 
2020, and the valve inspection record indicated in the left-hand column “OQ CT” required task 

 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for this maintenance activity was “716OP or 720OP”.  The OQ records provided for the 
contractor’s employee showed that the employee was not qualified for Task ID 716 or 720 until 
August 28, 2020.  Harvest provided records which showed the contractor was qualified to 
perform valve inspections on August 28, 2020, but Harvest did not have records indicating the 
operator was qualified to complete OQ-covered task number 716 or 720 prior to August 28, 
2020.  The valve inspection completed on August 26, 2020 was a covered task, requiring 
qualification for task 716 or 720, and was done by an unqualified individual. 

Harvest received a warning for a similar violation in 5-2022-002-NOPV.  They were cited under 
§ 195.505 on their Northstar hazardous liquid line for unqualified operators completing covered 
tasks.
