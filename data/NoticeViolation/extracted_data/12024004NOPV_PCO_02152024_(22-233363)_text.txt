NOTICE OF PROBABLE VIOLATION 
and 
PROPOSED COMPLIANCE ORDER 

OVERNIGHT EXPRESS DELIVERY 

February 15, 2024 

Mr. Matthew C. Lucey 
President and Chief Executive Officer 
PBF Energy Inc. 
1 Sylvan Way, Second Floor 
Parsippany, New Jersey 07054 

Dear Mr. Lucey: 

CPF 1-2024-004-NOPV 

From July 25, 2022 to July 29, 2022, representatives of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety 
Administration (PHMSA) pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 United States Code (U.S.C.) conducted an 
on-site inspection of Toledo Refining Company, LLC’s (TRC) control room management procedures 
and records of its Woodville Pipeline Control Room in Toledo, Ohio. 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that you have committed probable violations of the Pipeline 
and  the 
Safety  Regulations,  Title  49,  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR).  The  items  inspected 
probable violations are: 

1. 

§ 195.446 Control Room Management. 

(a) General. This section applies to each operator of a pipeline facility 
with a controller working in a control room who monitors and controls all 
or  part  of  a  pipeline  facility  through  a  SCADA  system.  Each  operator 
must have and follow written control room management procedures that 
implement the requirements of this section…. 

TRC failed to follow its written control room management procedures.  Specifically, TRC failed to 
follow its Control Room Management Plan (CRM Plan), Section 6.5 Alarm Management Plan Review 
in reviewing its alarm management plan to determine its effectiveness.  Section 195.446(e)(4) requires 
that TRC “[r]eview the alarm management plan required by this paragraph at least once each calendar 
year, but at intervals not exceeding 15 months, to determine the effectiveness of the plan.” 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
TRC’s CRM Plan, Section 6.5 reflects § 195.446(e)(4) requirements and requires a review of its alarm 
management plan each year, but at intervals not exceeding 15 months to determine the effectiveness 
of the plan.  This review was required to be recorded on Form 195.446(e)(4) per the CRM Plan. 

During the inspection, TRC was asked to produce records demonstrating that its alarm management 
plan  was  reviewed  from  2020  to  2021.  TRC  produced  documentation  that  indicated  its  plan  was 
reviewed on May 20, 2019 but was unable to produce any records for 2020 and 2021. 

Therefore, TRC failed to follow its written control room management procedures in order to ensure 
the alarm management plan was reviewed in compliance with § 195.446(e)(4) during 2020 and 2021. 

2. 

§ 195.446 Control Room Management. 

(a) General. This section applies to each operator of a pipeline facility 
with a controller working in a control room who monitors and controls all 
or  part  of  a  pipeline  facility  through  a  SCADA  system.  Each  operator 
must have and follow written control room management procedures that 
implement the requirements of this section…. 

TRC failed to follow its written control room management procedures.  Specifically, TRC failed to 
follow its Control Room Management Plan, December 16, 2021 (CRM Plan), Section 6.6 Operator 
Activity Monitoring (195.446(e)(5)) regarding monitoring the content and volume of general activity 
being directed to and required of each operator to ensure operators have sufficient time to analyze and 
react to incoming alarms.  Section 195.446(e)(5) requires that TRC "[m]onitor the content and volume 
of general activity being directed to and required of each controller at least once each calendar year, 
but at intervals not exceeding 15 months….” TRC’s CRM Plan, Section 6.6 reflects § 195.446(e)(5) 
requirements  and  requires  the  general  activity  review  to  be  performed  each  calendar  year,  but  at 
intervals not exceeding 15 months. 

During  the  inspection,  TRC  was  asked  to  produce  records  for  2019  to  2022  indicating  that  they 
monitored the content and volume of general activity being directed to and required of each controller 
at least once each calendar year but at intervals not exceeding 15 months, to ensure that its controllers 
have sufficient time to analyze and react to incoming alarms.  TRC did not produce any records to 
validate that the study had been conducted in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022. 

Therefore,  TRC  failed  to  follow  its  written  control  room  procedures  pursuant  to  compliance  with 
§ 195.446(e)(5) from 2019 to 2022. 

3. 

§ 195.446 Control Room Management. 

(a) …. 
(h) Training. Each  operator  must  establish  a  controller  training 
program  and  review  the  training  program  content  to  identify  potential 
improvements  at  least  once  each  calendar  year,  but  at  intervals  not  to 
exceed 15 months. An operator's program must provide for training each 
controller  to  carry  out  the  roles  and  responsibilities  defined  by  the 
operator.  In  addition,  the  training  program  must  include  the  following 
elements: 
(1) …. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(6) Control  room  team  training  and  exercises  that  include  both 
controllers  and  other  individuals,  defined  by  the  operator,  who  would 
reasonably  be  expected  to  operationally  collaborate  with  controllers 
(control  room  personnel)  during  normal,  abnormal  or  emergency 
situations. Operators  must  comply  with  the  team  training  requirements 
under this paragraph no later than January 23, 2018. 

TRC  failed  to  provide  team  training  which  included  individuals  other  than  controllers  who  would 
reasonably  be  expected  to  operationally  collaborate  with  controllers  during  normal,  abnormal  or 
emergency situations by the compliance deadline of January 23, 2018.  Specifically, TRC failed to 
provide  documentation  establishing  they  complied  with  the  team  training  requirements  in  § 
195.446(h)(6) by January 23, 2018. 

During  the  inspection,  PHMSA  requested  records  showing  that  TRC  had  conducted  team  training 
before  January  23,  2018.  The  records  provided  demonstrated  that  a  tabletop  training  exercise  was 
conducted  in  October  2020.    No  other  records  documenting  team  training  and  exercises  were 
submitted. 

Therefore, TRC failed to comply with the team training deadline of January 23, 2018 required by § 
195.446(h)(6). 

Proposed Civil Penalty
