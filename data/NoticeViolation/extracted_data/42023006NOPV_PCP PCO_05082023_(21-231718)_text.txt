Dear Mr. Britton: 

CPF 4-2023-006-NOPV 

On November 21, 2021, Interior Gas Utility (IGU) experienced a rupture of its 8-inch gas distribution main 
at  2942  Tria Road  in  Fairbanks,  Alaska.  Consequently,  a  representative  of  the  Pipeline  and  Hazardous 
Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 
United States Code (U.S.C.) video conferenced and investigated IGU’s LNG Storage Site #3 (SS3) Main 
in Fairbanks, Alaska. 

IGU notified PHMSA of two reportable incidents on December 20, 2021, after cold natural gas vapors from 
LNG  Storage  Site  #3  entered  the  downstream  gas  distribution  system  causing  a  rupture  of  an  8-inch 
distribution pipeline that released 559 mcf of gas and an emergency shutdown of the LNG facility.1  As a 
result of the investigation, it is alleged that IGU has committed probable violations of the Pipeline Safety 
Regulations,  Title  49,  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR).  The  items  investigated  and  the  probable 
violations are: 

1 IGU filed two separate incident notification reports for the emergency shutdown of the LNG facility and the 
rupture on its distribution line. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. 

§ 193.2441 Control center. 

Each LNG plant must have a control center from which operations and 
warning devices are monitored as required by this part. A control center must 
have the following capabilities and characteristics: 

(a) . . . . 
(c)  Each  control  center  must  have  personnel  in  continuous  attendance 
while  any  of  the  components  under  its  control  are  in  operation,  unless  the 
control is being performed from another control center which has personnel 
in continuous attendance. 

IGU failed to have personnel in continuous attendance in its control center or secondary control center while 
components under its control were in operation in accordance with § 193.2441(c).  Specifically, due to the 
absence of continuous attendance in its control room, IGU failed to notice low temperature alarms in  its 
control center that required an emergency shutdown of the LNG facility, a reportable incident.  This failure 
was  a  causal  factor  in  the  reportable  incidents.  Due  to  this  failure,  cold  gas  and  LNG  entered  a  gas 
distribution system.  The cold gas and LNG embrittled an 8-inch underground pipe, which ruptured and 
disrupted gas supply to 91 businesses and 144 residential homes. 

On November 21, 2021, prior to the incidents, IGU operators were not present in the SS3 control center 
while the facility was in operation.  The subsequent output data from a temperature sensor indicated that 
the lead vaporizer’s outlet temperature dropped below minimum safe operating levels.  According to IGU, 
when the temperature drops in this manner valves should close to protect the downstream piping and limit 
damage to the vaporizer. IGU’s standard operating procedure states that an operator is expected to perform 
a manual process at  the distributed control system human  machine interface to ensure the lag vaporizer 
operates  correctly.  If  an  operator  had  been  in  the  control  center  at  that  time,  the  operator  would  have 
detected the malfunctioning valve and initiated manual corrective action. 

Therefore, IGU failed to have personnel in continuous attendance in its control center or secondary control 
center while components under its control were in operation in accordance with § 193.2441(c). 

2. 

§ 193.2515 Investigations of failures. 

(a) . . . . 
(b)  As a result of the investigation, appropriate action must be taken to 

minimize recurrence of the incident. 

IGU failed to adequately take appropriate action to minimize recurrence of the incidents in accordance with 
§ 193.2515(b).  Specifically, after investigating the incidents IGU failed to review and implement changes 
throughout its procedures, tests, and design reviews to prevent recurrence of the incidents. 

IGU must review and implement changes where necessary to prevent recurrence of the incidents, including 
in its procedures, equipment design reviews, manufacturing test records, control systems design reviews, 
and control systems test records. 

Therefore,  IGU  failed  to  adequately  take  appropriate  action  to  minimize  recurrence  of  the  incidents  in 
accordance with § 193.2515(b).

Pursuant  to  49  U.S.C.  §  60118,  the  Pipeline  and  Hazardous  Materials  Safety  Administration  (PHMSA) 
proposes  to  issue  to  Interior  Gas  Utility  a  Compliance  Order  incorporating  the  following  remedial 
requirements to ensure the compliance of Interior Gas Utility with the pipeline safety regulations: 

A. 

B. 

C. 

D. 

In regard to Item 1 of the Notice pertaining to Interior Gas Utility’s failure 
to have personnel in continuous attendance in its control center while any 
of the components under its control were in operation,  Interior Gas Utility 
must develop and implement an operations procedure requiring personnel 
to be in continuous attendance in its SS3 control room in accordance with 
§ 193.2441(c). 

In regard to Item 2 of the Notice pertaining Interior Gas Utility’s failure to 
take appropriate action  to minimize recurrence of  the incidents, Interior 
Gas Utility must submit a detailed list of changes to prevent recurrence of 
the equipment failure in, at a minimum, the following areas: 

1.  Equipment Design Review 
2.  Manufacturing Test Records 
3.  Procedural Updates 
4.  Control Systems Design Review 
5.  Control Systems Test Records 

Interior  Gas  Utility  must  provide  documentation  of  the  completion  of 
paragraphs A and B to the Director, Southwest Region within 45 days of 
issuance of the Final Order. 

It  is  requested  (not  mandated)  that  Interior  Gas  Utility  maintain 
documentation of the safety improvement costs associated with fulfilling 
this  Compliance  Order  and  submit  the  total  to  the  Director,  Southwest 
Region,  Pipeline  and  Hazardous  Materials  Safety  Administration.  It  is 
requested  that  these  costs  be  reported  in  two  categories:  1)  total  cost 
associated  with  preparation/revision  of  plans,  procedures,  studies  and 
analyses,  and  2)  total  cost  associated  with  replacements,  additions  and 
other changes to pipeline infrastructure.
