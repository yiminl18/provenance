NOTICE OF PROBABLE VIOLATION 
and 
PROPOSED COMPLIANCE ORDER 

VIA E-MAIL TO MR. WAYNE LEIKER:  

February 6, 2023 

Mr. Wayne Leiker 
Vice President  
Calumet Montana Refining, LLC 
1020 Smelter Avenue, NE 
Black Eagle, MT 59414 

Dear Mr. Leiker: 

CPF 5-2023-021-NOPV 

From June 6, 2022, through June 10, 2022, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous 
Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 United States Code 
(U.S.C.), inspected your Bootlegger pipeline in Great Falls, Montana. 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that you have committed probable violations of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The items inspected 
and the probable violations are: 

1.   

§ 195.452 Pipeline integrity management in high consequence areas. 

(a) . . .  
(j) What is a continual process of evaluation and assessment to maintain a pipeline 
integrity? 
(1) . . . . 

 
 
  
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
(3) Assessment intervals. An operator must establish five-year intervals, not  
to exceed 68 months, for continually assessing the line pipe's integrity. An  
operator must base the assessment intervals on the risk the line pipe poses to  
the high consequence area to determine the priority for assessing the  
pipeline segments. An operator must establish the assessment intervals  
based on the factors specified in paragraph (e) of this section, the analysis of  
the results from the last integrity assessment, and the information analysis  
required by paragraph (g) of this section. 

Calumet Montana Refining, LLC (Calumet) failed to establish a five-year interval, not to exceed 
68 months, for continually assessing the Bootlegger pipeline’s integrity.1  Specifically, during 
the inspection, Calumet failed to provide records to show that it inspected its Bootlegger pipeline 
between its 2015 and 2022 integrity assessments.2 

2.   

§ 195.406 Maximum operating pressure. 

(a)  . . . . 
(b) No operator may permit the pressure in a pipeline during surges or other 
variations from normal operations to exceed 110 percent of the operating pressure 
limit established under paragraph (a) of this section. Each operator must provide 
adequate controls and protective equipment to control the pressure within this limit. 

Calumet failed to provide adequate controls and protective equipment to control the pressure of 
the Bootlegger pipeline within 110% of the operating pressure limit established under § 
195.406(a).  Specifically, during the inspection, PHMSA discovered that Calumet does not have 
the ability to control pipeline pressure within 110 percent of the established maximum operating 
pressure. The associated pressure control for this pipeline is owned and inspected by the 
upstream operator. 

Proposed Compliance Order 

Under 49 U.S.C. § 60122 and 49 CFR § 190.223, you are subject to a civil penalty not to exceed 
$257,664 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,576,627 for a 
related series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after March 21, 2022 and before 
January 6, 2023, the maximum penalty may not exceed $239,142 per violation per day the 
violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,391,412 for a related series of violations.  For violation 
occurring on or after May 3, 2021 and before March 21, 2022, the maximum penalty may not 
exceed $225,134 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,251,334 for 
a related series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after January 11, 2021 and before 
May 3, 2021, the maximum penalty may not exceed $222,504 per violation per day the violation 

1 The Bootlegger pipeline is a pipeline that could affect a high-consequence area (HCA), as defined in § 195.450, and 
therefore must comply with the integrity management regulations set forth in § 195.452. 

2  See  §  195.452(l)(1)  (requiring  operators  to  maintain  for  the  useful  life  of  the  pipeline  records  that  demonstrate 
compliance with § 195.452 requirements). 

Further, Calumet did not receive a variance from the 5-year requirement from PHMSA pursuant to § 195.452(j)(4). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
 
 
persists, up to a maximum of $2,225,034 for a related series of violations.  For violation 
occurring on or after July 31, 2019 and before January 11, 2021, the maximum penalty may not 
exceed $218,647 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,186,465 for 
a related series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after November 27, 2018 and before 
July 31, 2019, the maximum penalty may not exceed $213,268 per violation per day, with a 
maximum penalty not to exceed $2,132,679.  For violation occurring on or after November 2, 
2015 and before November 27, 2018, the maximum penalty may not exceed $209,002 per 
violation per day, with a maximum penalty not to exceed $2,090,022. 

We have reviewed the circumstances and supporting documents involved in this case and have 
decided not to propose a civil penalty assessment at this time. 

With respect to Item number 2, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 60118, the Pipeline and Hazardous 
Materials Safety Administration proposes to issue a Compliance Order to Calumet Montana 
Refining, LLC. Please refer to the Proposed Compliance Order, which is enclosed and made a
