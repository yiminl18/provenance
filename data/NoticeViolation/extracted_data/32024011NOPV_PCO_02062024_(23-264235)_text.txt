Mr. Mark Hewett 
President & CEO 
Northern Natural Gas Company 
1111 S. 103rd Street 
Omaha, NE 68124 

Dear Mr. Hewett: 

CPF 3-2024-011-NOPV 

From April 10 through May 4, 2023, representatives of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 
Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), along with representatives 
from the Michigan Public Service Commission, Minnesota Office of Pipeline Safety, and the 
Iowa Utility Board acting as Interstate Agents, pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 United States Code 
(U.S.C.), inspected Northern Natural Gas Company’s (NNG) procedures and records for class 
location in Omaha, Nebraska. 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that you have committed a probable violation of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The item inspected 
and the probable violation is: 

1. 

§ 192.5 Class locations. 

(a) . . . . 
(c) The length of Class locations 2, 3, and 4 may be adjusted as follows: 
(1) . . . . 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(2) When a cluster of buildings intended for human occupancy requires a Class 2 or 
3 location, the class location ends 220 yards (200 meters) from the nearest building 
in the cluster. 

NNG’s determination of the boundaries for a Class 2 or 3 area was not consistent with the 
class location criteria as required by § 192.5(c)(2). Specifically, NNG utilized clustering 
to reduce the size of a Class 2 or 3 area, which is allowed by the regulations. However, 
NNG’s procedure 80.101 for class location determination, which cross-referenced NNG’s 
Engineering Standard (ES) 0060, allowed NNG to utilize three (3) buildings as the 
minimum size for the cluster. This methodology allowed NNG to reduce the class 
location of areas with occupied buildings that were originally classed to a higher class 
location by the original sliding mile analysis. § 192.5(c)(2) indicates that the length of 
Class locations 2, 3, and 4 can be adjusted, but operators cannot downgrade the actual 
class location. As a result, the true length of the Class 2 or 3 location may not be defined 
correctly because those three or less buildings would have extended the length of the 
Class 2 or 3 location. 

During PHMSA’s inspection, inspectors reviewed NNG’s class locations in random areas 
of the NNG pipeline system and identified two locations (three examples) where 
clustering was used to reduce the length of a Class 3 area, because there were less than 
three occupied buildings. The locations identified are as follows: 

•  Line M560B-05 
•  Line MNB87702-08 
•  Line 179MNB87701 

Lat/Long: 42.4569639, -96.3017361 
Lat/Long: 45.2634194, -93.3974167 
(Same location as above; parallel line) 

In the above examples, NNG’s clustering methodology allowed the class locations in all 
examples to be derated from Class 3 to Class 1. In looking at the Class 1 area directly 
adjacent to the Class 3 areas, there were occupied structures (less than three) where the 
class reduction occurred. All the structures were within the original sliding mile for a 
Class 3. NNG’s ES 0060, referenced from procedure 80.101, allowed the location of 
these buildings to be downgraded from a Class 3 to a Class 1 area, thereby reducing the 
true length of the Class 3 area. 

By using a methodology that allowed three buildings to be clustered, NNG downgraded 
multiple Class 3 locations, in violation of § 192.5(c)(2). 

Proposed Civil Penalty 

Under 49 U.S.C. § 60122 and 49 CFR § 190.223, you are subject to a civil penalty not to exceed 
$266,015 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,660,135 for a 
related series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after January 6, 2023 and before 
December 28, 2023, the maximum penalty may not exceed $257,664 per violation per day the 
violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,576,627 for a related series of violations.  For violation 
occurring on or after March 21, 2022 and before January 6, 2023, the maximum penalty may not

violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,186,465 for a related series of violations.  For violation 
occurring on or after November 27, 2018 and before July 31, 2019, the maximum penalty may

exceed $209,002 per violation per day, with a maximum penalty not to exceed $2,090,022. 

We have reviewed the circumstances and supporting documents involved in this case, and have 
decided not to propose a civil penalty assessment at this time.

PROPOSED COMPLIANCE ORDER 

Pursuant to 49 United States Code § 60118, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety 
Administration (PHMSA) proposes to issue to NNG a Compliance Order incorporating the
following remedial requirements to ensure the compliance of NNG with the pipeline safety 
regulations: 

A. 

In regard to Item 1 of the Notice pertaining to the incorrect application of class 
location clustering, NNG must do the following: 

•  Revise ES 0060, which is referenced from Procedure 80.101, to ensure 
that any class location with occupied structures established from the 
original sliding mile analysis is not derated to a lower class location for 
any reason. 

•  Submit the revision within 90 days of receipt of the Final Order. 
•  Train NNG personnel on the new procedure and submit the training 

• 

records within 150 days of receipt of the Final Order. 
Implement and complete the new procedure system wide to re-evaluate the 
lengths of the existing Class 2 and 3 locations upon completion of the 
revised procedures. 

•  Provide PHMSA a quarterly update on the status of the re-evaluation. 
•  The revised evaluation of the system must be completed within 360 days 
of the receipt of the Final Order. Any requests for an extension must be 
made a minimum of 30 days in advance. 

B. 

It is requested that NNG maintain documentation of the safety improvement costs 
associated with fulfilling this Compliance Order and submit the total to Gregory 
A Ochs, Director, Central Region, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety 
Administration. It is requested that these costs be reported in two categories: (1) 
total cost associated with preparation/revision of plans, procedures, studies and 
analyses, and (2) total cost associated with replacements, additions and other 
changes to pipeline infrastructure.
