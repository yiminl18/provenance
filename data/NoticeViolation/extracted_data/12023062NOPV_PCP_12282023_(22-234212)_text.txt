and

Mr. Jim Fedena 
Senior Vice President, Logistics 
Delaware Pipeline Company LLC 
1 Sylvan Way, 2nd floor 
Parsippany, New Jersey 07054 

Dear Mr. Fedena: 

CPF 1-2023-062-NOPV 

From March 28 to March 29, 2023, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety 
Administration  (PHMSA),  Office  of  Pipeline  Safety  (OPS),  pursuant  to  Chapter  601  of  49  United 
States Code (U.S.C.) inspected Delaware Pipeline Company LLC’s (DPC) pipeline facilities as part of 
an integrated inspection from Delaware City, DE, to Twin Oaks, PA. 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that you have committed a probable violation of the Pipeline 
Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The item inspected and the probable 
violation is: 

1. 

§ 195.583 What must I do to monitor atmospheric corrosion control? 

(a)  You  must  inspect  each  pipeline  or  portion  of  pipeline  that  is 
exposed  to  the  atmosphere  for  evidence  of  atmospheric  corrosion,  as 
follows: 

If the pipeline is located: 
Onshore 

Offshore 

Then the frequency of inspection is: 

At least once every 3 calendar years, but with intervals not 
exceeding 39 months 
At least once each calendar year, but with intervals not 
exceeding 15 months 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DPC  failed  to  monitor  portions  of  the  pipeline  that  are  exposed  to  the  atmosphere  for  evidence  of 
atmospheric corrosion.  Specifically, DPC failed to conduct inspections on portions of pipeline that are 
exposed to the atmosphere within subsurface vaults as required by § 195.583(a).  Subsurface vaults are 
underground structures that may be entered and may contain piping and piping components, such as 
valves and pressure regulators.  These piping and piping components may be exposed to atmospheric 
corrosion,  and  therefore  are  required  to  be  inspected  pursuant  to  § 195.583(a)  for  evidence  of 
atmospheric corrosion. 

During  the  inspection,  PHMSA  observed  that  sections  of  pipe  in  subsurface  vaults  upstream  and 
downstream  of  block  valves  #207  and  #208 were exposed  to the  atmosphere  and  bore  evidence  of 
corrosion and inadequate protective coating.  Similar conditions were observed at block valve #203, 
and  block  valve  #210,  with  significant  coating  deterioration  at  block  valve  #210.  PHMSA  then 
requested  records  to  confirm  that  these  sections  of  pipe  were  being  monitored  for  atmospheric 
corrosion;  however,  DPC  was  unable  to  provide  any  records.  PHMSA  also  requested  written 
procedures requiring pipe in subsurface vaults which was exposed to the atmosphere to be considered 
under  an  atmospheric  corrosion  program.  However,  DPC  could  not  furnish  such  procedures,  nor 
provide  engineering  justification  as  to  why  that  pipe  was  not  being  monitored  for  atmospheric 
corrosion. 

Therefore, DPC failed to monitor portions of the pipeline that are located within subsurface vaults and 
exposed to the atmosphere for evidence of atmospheric corrosion as required by § 195.583(a). 

Proposed Civil Penalty 

Under  49  U.S.C.  §  60122  and  49  CFR  §  190.223,  you  are  subject  to  a  civil  penalty  not  to  exceed 
$257,664 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,576,627 for a related 
series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after March 21, 2022, and before January 6, 2023, 
the maximum penalty may not exceed $239,142 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a 
maximum of $2,391,412 for a related series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after May 3, 
2021, and before March 21, 2022, the maximum penalty may not exceed $225,134 per violation per 
day  the  violation  persists,  up  to  a  maximum  of  $2,251,334  for  a  related  series  of  violations.    For 
violation occurring on or after January 11, 2021, and before May 3, 2021, the maximum penalty may 
not exceed $222,504 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,225,034 for a 
related series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after July 31, 2019, and before January 11, 
2021, the maximum penalty may not exceed $218,647 per violation per day the violation persists, up 
to  a  maximum  of  $2,186,465  for  a  related  series  of  violations.  For  violation  occurring on  or  after 
November 27, 2018, and before July 31, 2019, the maximum penalty may not exceed $213,268 per 
violation per day, with a maximum penalty not to exceed $2,132,679.  For violation occurring on or 
after  November  2,  2015,  and  before  November  27,  2018,  the  maximum  penalty  may  not  exceed 
$209,002 per violation per day, with a maximum penalty not to exceed $2,090,022. 

We have reviewed the circumstances and supporting documentation involved for the above probable 
violation and recommend that you be preliminarily assessed a civil penalty of $50,200 as follows:
