Michael Koby 
Vice President, U.S. Operations 
Enbridge Energy, L.P. 
5400 Westheimer Court 
Houston, TX 77056 

Dear Mr. Koby: 

CPF 3-2023-011-NOPV 

From March 14 through August 12, 2022, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 
Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 
United States Code (U.S.C.), inspected Enbridge Energy, L.P.’s (Enbridge)  Lakehead, Toledo, and 
New York pipelines and facilities in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and New York. 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that Enbridge has committed probable violations of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The items inspected  and 
the probable violations are: 

1. 

§ 195.402 Procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies 
(a)  General. Each operator shall prepare and follow for each pipeline system a manual of 
written procedures for conducting normal operations and maintenance activities and 
handling abnormal operations and emergencies. This manual shall be reviewed at 
intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each calendar year, and appropriate 
changes made as necessary to insure that the manual is effective. This manual shall be 
prepared before initial operations of a pipeline system commence, and appropriate parts 
shall be kept at locations where operations and maintenance activities are conducted. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Enbridge failed to follow its standard operation and maintenance procedures regarding pipeline valve 
labeling.  Specifically, valve labels for Line 78 reference Line 6 in the valve identification string.  Line 
6B is a retired pipeline that runs parallel to Line 78 and is permanently enjoined from operating per 
EPA consent decree.  Per Appendix J, Section 5.2.2. of Enbridge’s Functional Tag Number Standard 
(FTNS) procedure DS-002 Standard – Liquids Pipelines, Version Number 20.0, dated 2022-04-27, 
valve identifiers should include the mile post, line number, and the functional tag number.  The 
functional tag number for mainline valve number709.16-6-V (emphasis added), for example, 
incorrectly references Line 6 in the identifier rather than Line 78. 

2. 

§ 195.402 Procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies. 

(a) . . . . 
(c)  Maintenance and normal operations. The manual required by paragraph (a) of this 
section must include procedures for the following to provide safety during maintenance 
and normal operations: 
(1) . . . . 
(7) Starting up and shutting down any part of the pipeline system in a manner designed 
to assure operation within the limits prescribed by § 195.406, consider the hazardous 
liquid or carbon dioxide in transportation, variations in altitude along the pipeline, and 
pressure monitoring and control devices. 

Enbridge failed to have sufficient procedures in place to prevent an abnormal operation on its Line 5 
after the commissioning of two Emergency Flow Restrictive Devices (EFRD) at MP 1532 and MP 
1621.  Enbridge experienced multiple overpressure events, the highest being 124% of the maximum 
operating pressure (MOP), on 12/5/2018 during the restart of Line 5 after the new EFRD valve 
installations.  The EFRD at MP 1621 was frozen and the field crew was still working to thaw it when 
the pipeline was restarted. The crew was not aware of a change in project scope and the decision to not 
commission the valve at MP 1621 and to restart the pipeline.  During the line restart the field crew 
began moving the valve to check the valve limits which caused the overpressure events. 

Enbridge conducted a follow-up investigation of the incident and issued a CCO High Value Learning 
Event Report (20236) dated December 2018.  The investigation revealed the causes of the incident, to 
include failing to clearly coordinate or communicate work activity and failure to identify the risk and 
assess the hazards. 

Enbridge implemented several actions because of its investigation, including revisions to its COPAS 
procedures, providing awareness to the CCO Operators and circulating the High Value Lesson Learned 
to staff. 

3. 

§ 195.573 What must I do to monitor external corrosion control? 

(a) Protected pipelines. You must do the following to determine whether cathodic 

protection required by this subpart complies with § 195.571: 

(1) Conduct tests on the protected pipeline at least once each calendar year, but with 

intervals not exceeding 15 months. However, if tests at those intervals are impractical 
for separately protected short sections of bare or ineffectively coated pipelines, testing 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
may be done at least once every 3 calendar years, but with intervals not exceeding 39 
months. 

Enbridge failed to conduct tests to ensure cathodic protection meets the applicable criteria on Line 6B 
and inactive segments on Line 10 at least once each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 15 
months for calendar years 2020 and 2021.  Specifically, annual cathodic protection (CP) survey 
measurements were discontinued in years 2020 and 2021 as part of a Covid-19 exposure risk reduction 
plan. Enbridge considers pipeline 6B low risk since it has been purged from Griffith, Indiana, to 
Stockbridge, Michigan, and is under Consent Decree injunction of permanent enjoinment preventing 
Enbridge from ever restarting the line.  However, the status of these lines is listed as active (unfilled) 
and, as such, requires operators to comply with all applicable safety requirements, including periodic 
maintenance, damage prevention programs and public awareness programs. Enbridge believed it could 
defer the CP surveys and other certain maintenance activities based on PHMSA Bulletin ADB- 2016-
05 which mentions deferring certain activities impractical on purged but active pipelines, such as in-
line inspection.  The performance of an annual cathodic protection survey is essential to ensuring that 
purged but active pipelines are not corroding.  Conducting annual cathodic protection surveys is also 
not dependent on whether the pipeline is filled or not, hence purging does not excuse timely 
compliance with § 195.573(a)(1).a  The advisory bulletin does not state cathodic protection surveys are 
impractical on purged but active pipelines. 

Proposed Civil Penalty 
Under 49 U.S.C. § 60122 and 49 CFR § 190.223, you are subject to a civil penalty not to exceed 
$257,664 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,576,627 for a related 
series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after March 21, 2022 and before January 6, 2023, the 
maximum penalty may not exceed $239,142 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a 
maximum of $2,391,412 for a related series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after May 3, 
2021 and before March 21, 2022, the maximum penalty may not exceed $225,134 per violation per day 
the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,251,334 for a related series of violations.  For violation 
occurring on or after January 11, 2021 and before May 3, 2021, the maximum penalty may not exceed 
$222,504 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,225,034 for a related 
series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after July 31, 2019 and before January 11, 2021, the 
maximum penalty may not exceed $218,647 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a 
maximum of $2,186,465 for a related series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after 
November 27, 2018 and before July 31, 2019, the maximum penalty may not exceed $213,268 per 
violation per day, with a maximum penalty not to exceed $2,132,679.  For violation occurring on or 
after November 2, 2015 and before November 27, 2018, the maximum penalty may not exceed 
$209,002 per violation per day, with a maximum penalty not to exceed $2,090,022. 

We have reviewed the circumstances and supporting documentation involved for the above probable 
violations and recommend that you be preliminarily assessed a civil penalty of $ 18,600 as follows:
