Mr. Todd Cantrall 
Vice President of Operations Oil and Gas 
Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas 
21 Waterway Ave., Suite 250 
The Woodlands, TX 77380 

Dear Mr. Cantrall: 

CPF 5-2023-031-NOPV 

From October 4 through 7, 2022, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety 
Administration (PHMSA), pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 United States Code, inspected your 8-
inch diameter oil pipeline from Platform Irene to the Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant in California. 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that Freeport-McMoRan Oil and Gas (FMOG) has 
committed probable violations of the Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR).  The items inspected and the probable violations are: 

1. 

§ 194.7  Operating restrictions and interim operating authorization. 

(a)  . . . . 
(b)  An operator must operate its onshore pipeline facilities in accordance with the 
applicable response plan.

plan. Specifically, at the time of PHMSA inspection, FMOG could not provide records to 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
demonstrate that the oil spill response drill had been conducted as required by its Oil Spill 
Response Plan, Section 9.2 - Spill Response Drills. 

2. 

§ 194.117  Training. 

(a)  . . . . 
(b)  Each operator shall maintain a training record for each individual that has been 
trained as required by this section. These records must be maintained in the 
following manner as long as the individual is assigned duties under the response 
plan: 
(1)  Records for operator personnel must be maintained at the operator's 
headquarters; and 
(2)  Records for personnel engaged in response, other than operator personnel, shall 
be maintained as determined by the operator. 

FMOG failed to maintain training records for each individual. Specifically, at the time of 
PHMSA inspection, FMOG could not provide training records for 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 to 
show that their Incident Management Team has been trained as required by its Oil Spill 
Response Plan, Section 9.1 - Training 

3. 

§ 194.121  Response plan review and update procedures. 

(a)  Each operator shall update its response plan to address new or different 
operating conditions or information. In addition, each operator shall review its 
response plan in full at least every 5 years from the date of the last submission or the 
last approval as follows: 
(1)  For substantial harm plans, an operator shall resubmit its response plan to OPS 
every 5 years from the last submission date. 
(2)  For significant and substantial harm plans, an operator shall resubmit every 5 
years from the last approval date. 

FMOG failed to review its response plan in full at least every five years from the date of the last 
submission or the last approval. Specifically, at the time of the PHMSA inspection, FMOG could 
not provide records to show that it resubmitted its response plan to PHMSA every five years 
from the last submission date. The last time that FMOG submitted its response plan and was 
approved by PHMSA was in 20171. The operator was due to resubmit its response plan to 
PHMSA in 2022. 

4. 

§ 195.402  Procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies. 

(a)  General.  Each operator shall prepare and follow for each pipeline system a 
manual of written procedures for conducting normal operations and maintenance

and appropriate changes made as necessary to insure that the manual is effective. 
This manual shall be prepared before initial operations of a pipeline system 
commence, and appropriate parts shall be kept at locations where operations and 
maintenance activities are conducted. 

FMOG failed to review at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each calendar 
year, and appropriate changes made as necessary to insure that the emergencies response manual 
is effective. Specifically, at the time of the PHMSA inspection, FMOG could not provide records 
to demonstrate that their emergency plan had been reviewed in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. 

5. 

§ 195.403  Emergency response training. 

(a)  . . . . 
(b)  At the intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each calendar year, 
each operator shall: 
(1)  Review with personnel their performance in meeting the objectives of the 
emergency response training program set forth in paragraph (a) of this section; and 

FMOG failed to review at the intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each calendar 
year, with personnel their performance in meeting the objectives of the emergency response 
training program. Specifically, at the time of PHMSA inspection, FMOG could not provide 
2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 records to demonstrate compliance with § 195.403(b)(1). 

6. 

§ 195.403  Emergency response training. 

(a)  . . . . 
(c)  Each operator shall require and verify that its supervisors maintain a thorough 
knowledge of that portion of the emergency response procedures established under 
§ 195.402 for which they are responsible to ensure compliance. 

FMOG failed to require and verify that its supervisors maintained a thorough knowledge of that 
portion of the emergency response procedures established under § 195.402, for which they are 
responsible to ensure compliance. Specifically, at the time of PHMSA inspection, FMOG could 
not provide 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 records to demonstrate compliance with § 195.403(c). 

7. 

§ 195.412  Inspection of rights-of-way and crossings under navigable waters. 

(a)  Each operator shall, at intervals not exceeding 3 weeks, but at least 26 times 
each calendar year, inspect the surface conditions on or adjacent to each pipeline 
right-of-way. Methods of inspection include walking, driving, flying or other 
appropriate means of traversing the right-of-way. 

FMOG failed at intervals not exceeding 3 weeks, but at least 26 times each calendar year, to 
inspect the surface conditions on or adjacent to each pipeline right-of-way. Specifically, at the 
time of the PHMSA inspection, FMOG could not provide 2019 and 2020 records to demonstrate 
that the onshore portion of  8” oil pipeline has been inspected.

§ 195.420  Valve maintenance. 

(a)  . . . . 
(b)  Each operator shall, at intervals not exceeding 7 ½  months, but at least twice 
each calendar year, inspect each mainline valve to determine that it is functioning 
properly. 

FMOG failed to inspect at intervals not exceeding 7 ½ months, but at least twice each calendar 
year, each mainline valve, to determine that it is functioning properly. Specifically, at the time of 
the PHMSA inspection, FMOG could not provide the 2020 and 2021 records to demonstrate 
compliance with § 195.420(b). 

9. 

§195.440 Public awareness. 

(a)… 
(c) The operator must follow the general program recommendations, including 
baseline and supplemental requirements of API RP 1162, unless the operator 
provides justification in its program or procedural manual as to why compliance 
with all or certain provisions of the recommended practice is not practicable and 
not necessary for safety. 

FMOG failed to follow the general program recommendations of API RP 1162. Specifically, at 
the time of PHMSA inspection, FMOG could not provide 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 records to 
demonstrate that liaison with fire, police, and other appropriate public officials to learn the 
responsibility and resources of each government organization that may respond to a hazardous 
liquid pipeline emergency and acquaint the officials with the operator's ability in responding to a 
hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide pipeline emergency and means of communication has been 
established and maintained. 

10. 

§ 195.452  Pipeline integrity management in high consequence areas. 

(h)  What actions must an operator take to address integrity issues?  -
(1) …. 
(2) Discovery of condition.  Discovery of a condition occurs when an operator has 
adequate information to determine that a condition presenting a potential threat to 
the integrity of the pipeline exists. An operator must promptly, but no later than 180 
days after an assessment, obtain sufficient information about a condition to make 
that determination, unless the operator can demonstrate the 180-day interval is 
impracticable. If the operator believes that 180 days are impracticable to make a 
determination about a condition found during an assessment, the pipeline operator 
must notify PHMSA in accordance with paragraph (m) of this section and provide 
an expected date when adequate information will become available. 

FMOG failed to promptly, but no later than 180 days after an assessment, obtain sufficient 
information about a condition.  Specifically, the PHMSA inspector reviewed the Inline 

 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
    
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Inspection (ILI) Final Report for the ILI survey that was conducted on November 9, 2021.2 The 
ILI Report indicated 71 counts of 180-day conditions - corrosion of or along a longitudinal seam 
weld as per § 195.452 (h)(4)(iii)(H). However, FMOG could not provide records or 
documentation to show that they promptly, but no later than 180 days after an assessment, 
obtained sufficient information about the 71 counts of 180-day condition and that any required 
repair has been conducted. 

11. 

§ 195.573  What must I do to monitor external corrosion control? 

(a)  Protected pipelines. You must do the following to determine whether cathodic 
protection required by this subpart complies with § 195.571: 
(1)  . . . . 
(2)  Identify not more than 2 years after cathodic protection is installed, the 
circumstances in which a close-interval survey or comparable technology is 
practicable and necessary to accomplish the objectives of paragraph 10.1.1.3 of 
NACE SP 0169 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3). 

FMOG failed to identify, within the required time frame, the circumstances in which a close 
interval survey or comparable technology is practicable and necessary to accomplish the 
objectives of paragraph 10.1.1.3 of NACE Standard SP0169-2007. Specifically, at the time of 
inspection, FMOG could not provide records to demonstrate compliance with § 195.573(a)(2).3 

12. 

§ 195.583  What must I do to monitor atmospheric corrosion control? 

(a)  . . . . 
(b)  During inspections you must give particular attention to pipe at soil-to-air 
interfaces, under thermal insulation, under disbonded coatings, at pipe supports, in 
splash zones, at deck penetrations, and in spans over water. 

FMOG failed to give particular attention to pipe supports during atmospheric corrosion 
inspection. At the time of PHMSA field inspection, it was observed that the above-ground pipe 
at valve Site 1 had pipe support that is in contact with the pipe surface, which made inspection of 
the pipe surface for atmospheric corrosion impossible.4 

13. 

§ 195.589  What corrosion control information do I have to maintain? 

(a)  . . . . 
(c)  You must maintain a record of each analysis, check, demonstration, 
examination, inspection, investigation, review, survey, and test required by this 
subpart in sufficient detail to demonstrate the adequacy of corrosion control

retain these records for at least 5 years, except that records related to §§ 195.569, 
195.573(a) and (b), and 195.579(b)(3) and (c) must be retained for as long as the 
pipeline remains in service. 

FMOG failed to maintain a record of each analysis, check, demonstration, examination, 
inspection, investigation, review, survey, and test required in sufficient detail to demonstrate the 
adequacy of corrosion control measures or that corrosion requiring control measures did not 
exist: 

(1)  At the time of PHMSA inspection, FMOG could not provide records to demonstrate that 
pipeline or portion of the pipeline that is exposed to the atmosphere at the Lompoc Oil and Gas 
Plant facility has been inspected for evidence of atmospheric corrosion at least once every 3 
calendar years, but with intervals not exceeding 39 months as required by § 195.583(a). 

(2) At the time of PHMSA inspection, FMOG could not provide records to demonstrate that 
pipeline or portion of pipeline that is exposed to the atmosphere at Platform Irene has been 
inspected for evidence of atmospheric corrosion at least once each calendar year but with 
intervals not exceeding 15 months as required by § 195.583(a).  

(3) At the time of PHMSA inspection, FMOG could not provide records to demonstrate that they 
corrected any identified deficiency in corrosion control as required by §195.401(b). Specifically, 
PHMSA reviewed their Pipe-to-Soil Annual Survey, but FMOG could not provide records to 
demonstrate that the cathodic protection reading that did not meet the -850 mV on-criterion 
found in 2020 and 2021 at Valve Station #10 has been repaired.5
