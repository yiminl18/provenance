Dear Mr. Bacon: 

From  February  2  through  September  6,  2022,  a  representative  of  the  Pipeline  and  Hazardous 
Materials  Safety  Administration  (PHMSA)  pursuant  to  Chapter  601  of  49  United  States  Code 
(U.S.C.)  inspected  Enterprise  Products  Operating  LLC’s  (Enterprise)  procedures,  records  and 
facilities for the Texas Express Pipeline System in Houston, Mont Belvieu, and Skellytown, Texas. 

As  a  result  of  the  inspection,  it  is  alleged  that  you  have  committed  probable  violations  of  the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The items inspected 
and the probable violations are: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
1. 

§ 195.406 Maximum operating pressure. 

(a) . . . . 
(b) No operator may permit the pressure in a pipeline during surges 
or other variations from normal operations to exceed 110 percent of the 
operating  pressure  limit  established  under  paragraph  (a)  of  this 
section.  Each operator must provide adequate controls and protective 
equipment to control the pressure within this limit. 

Enterprise failed to provide adequate controls to control the pressure within 110 percent of the 
operating limit in accordance with § 195.406(b).  Specifically, Enterprise established shutdown 
limits at 115 percent of the operating pressure limit, rather than 110 percent, at its Memphis, Archer 
City, and Reliance pump stations. 

During the inspection, the testing of the high pressure shut down at the pump stations revealed that 
the  settings  for  the  alarms  were  greater  than  110  percent  of  the  maximum  operating  pressure 
(MOP) at the stations.  Enterprise acknowledged that it had established the Moore relay shutdown 
limits at the six new stations at 115% of established MOP, rather than 110% of MOP. 

Therefore, Enterprise failed to provide adequate controls to control the pressure within 110 percent 
of the operating limit in accordance with § 195.406(b). 

2. 

§ 195.52 Immediate notice of certain accidents. 

(a) Notice  requirements.  At  the  earliest  practicable  moment 
following  discovery,  of  a  release  of  the  hazardous  liquids  or carbon 
dioxide transported resulting in an event described in § 195.50, but no 
later  than  one  hour  after  confirmed  discovery,  the operator of  the 
system  must  give  notice,  in  accordance  with  paragraph  (b)  of  this 
section of any failure that: 

(1) . . . . 
(2) Resulted in either a fire or explosion not intentionally set by the 

operator; 

(3)  Caused  estimated  property  damage,  including  cost  of  cleanup 
and recovery, value of lost product, and damage to the property of the 
operator or others, or both, exceeding $50,000; 

Enterprise  failed  to  notify  the  National  Response  Center  within  one  hour  following  confirmed 
discovery of a release in accordance with § 195.52(a)(2) & (a)(3).  Specifically, Enterprise failed 
to notify the NRC of two reportable accidents within one hour that occurred on July 18, 2019, and 
May 24, 2022. 

With respect to the first reportable accident, a flash fire occurred on July 18, 2019, at 1:15 pm 
during installation of a bypass spool between pig traps at the Hammond pump station.  Enterprise 
notified NRC at 2:30 pm, over one hour after confirmed discovery (NRC Accident Report No. 
20190257-32990). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
With respect to the second reportable accident, Enterprise observed a vapor cloud at 7:21 am on 
May 24, 2022 that caused estimated property damage exceeding $50,000.  Enterprise notified NRC 
at 9:09 am, over one hour after confirmed discovery (NRC Accident Report No. 20220118-36757). 

Therefore, Enterprise failed to notify the NRC within one hour following confirmed discovery of 
a release in accordance with § 195.52(a)(2) & (a)(3).

PROPOSED COMPLIANCE ORDER 

Pursuant  to  49  United  States  Code  §  60118,  the  Pipeline  and  Hazardous  Materials  Safety 
Administration (PHMSA) proposes to issue to Enterprise Products Operating, LLC (Enterprise) a 
Compliance Order incorporating the following remedial requirements to ensure the compliance of 
Enterprise with the pipeline safety regulations: 

A. 

B. 

In  regard  to  Item  1  of  the  Notice  pertaining  to  Enterprise’s  failure  to  provide 
adequate  controls  to  control  the  pressure  on  its  Moore  relay  systems  used  for 
protection  of  pumping  equipment  from  exceeding  110  percent  of  the  operating 
pressure limit established, Enterprise must reprogram and reset the alarm limits to 
a maximum of 110% of the established maximum operating pressure at all six new 
pump  stations  within  30  days  of  the  issuance  of  the  Final  Order  and  submit 
corresponding records within 90 days of the issuance of the Final Order. 

It  is requested (not mandated) that Enterprise maintain documentation of the safety 
improvement costs associated with fulfilling this Compliance Order and submit the 
total  to  Bryan  Lethcoe,  Director,  Southwest  Region,  Pipeline  and  Hazardous 
Materials Safety Administration.  It is requested that these costs be reported in two 
categories: 1) total cost associated with preparation/revision of plans, procedures, 
studies and analyses, and 2) total cost associated with replacements, additions and 
other changes to pipeline infrastructure.
