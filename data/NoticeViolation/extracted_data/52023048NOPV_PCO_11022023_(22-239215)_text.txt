and 
PROPOSED COMPLIANCE ORDER 

VIA ELECTRONIC MAIL TO: Craig.Hoeferlin@spireenergy.com 

November 2, 2023 

Mr. Craig Hoeferlin 
Vice President, Operations Services and SMS 
Clear Creek Storage Company, LLC 
700 Market Street 
St. Louis, MO 63101 

Dear Mr. Hoeferlin: 

CPF 5-2023-048-NOPV 

From September 26 through 30, 2022, representatives of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 
Safety Administration (PHMSA), pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 United States Code, inspected 
the Clear Creek Storage Company, LLC (Clear Creek) control room procedures and records for 
the control room located at the Clear Creek Storage field north of Evanston, Wyoming. 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that you have committed probable violations of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The items inspected 
and the probable violation(s) are: 

1.  § 191.22 National Registry of Operators. 

(a) … 
(c) Changes. Each operator of a gas pipeline, gas pipeline facility, UNGSF, LNG 
plant, or LNG facility must notify PHMSA electronically through the National 
Registry of Operators at https://portal.phmsa.dot.gov of certain events. 
(1) An operator must notify PHMSA of any of the following events not later than 60 
days before the event occurs: 
(i) Construction of any planned rehabilitation, replacement, modification, upgrade, 
uprate, or update of a facility, other than a section of line pipe, that costs $10 million 
or more. If 60-day notice is not feasible because of an emergency, an operator must 
notify PHMSA as soon as practicable; 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
(ii) Construction of 10 or more miles of a new pipeline; 

Clear Creek failed to notify PHMSA not later than 60 days before the start of construction of the 
Clear Creek Storage Company Expansion Project, as required.  During the control room 
inspection that took place from September 26 to 30, 2023, the PHMSA inspector observed 
various  construction activities at the Clear Creek Storage plant site, including moving dirt and 
welding.  However Clear Creek did not file the National Registry Notification, until  December 
9, 2022 1 which was 78 days after the observed commencement of construction activities, and at 
least 138 days after the time § 191.22(c)(1) requires. 

Therefore, Clear Creak failed to notify PHMSA 60 days prior to the start of construction on the 
Clear Creek Storage Company Expansion Project as required. 

2. 

§ 192.631  Control room management. 

(a)  … 
(c) Provide adequate information.  Each operator must provide its controllers with 
the information, tools, processes and procedures necessary for the controllers to 
carry out the roles and responsibilities the operator has defined by performing each 
of the following: 
(1) … 
(3) Test and verify an internal communication plan to provide adequate means for 
manual operation of the pipeline safely, at least once each calendar year, but at 
intervals not to exceed 15 months; 

Clear Creek failed to test and verify its internal communications plan at least once each calendar 
year, but at intervals not to exceed 15 months, to provide adequate means for manual operation 
of the pipeline safely.  Specifically, during inspection, Clear Creek could not provide 
documentation demonstrating it had tested and verified its internal communications plan for the 
years 2019, 2020 and 2021. 

Therefore, Clear Creek failed to test and verify its internal communication plan as required 
pursuant to § 192.631(c)(3). 

3. 

§ 192.631  Control room management. 

(a)  … 
(c)  Provide adequate information.  Each operator must provide its controllers with 
the information, tools, processes and procedures necessary for the controllers to 
carry out the roles and responsibilities the operator has defined by performing each 
of the following: 
(1) … 
(4)  Test any backup SCADA systems at least once each calendar year, but at 
intervals not to exceed 15 months; 

1 See National Registry Notification 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Clear Creek failed to complete the required test of any backup SCADA systems at least once 
each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15 months.  Specifically, Clear Creek could not 
provide any documentation demonstrating it had tested the backup SCADA system, which is 
collocated with the primary server, at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 
15 months for the years 2019, 2020 and 2021. 

Therefore, Clear Creek failed to test its backup SCADA systems at least once a calendar year, at 
intervals not to exceed 15 months, as required. 

4. 

§ 192.631  Control room management. 

(a)  … 
(e)  Alarm management. Each operator using a SCADA system must have a written 
alarm management plan to provide for effective controller response to alarms. 

Clear Creek failed to develop a written alarm management plan as required by  §192.631(e). 
Specifically, a review of the Clear Creek Control Room Management manual demonstrated that 
the manual did not contain a written alarm management plan.2  Clear Creek utilizes a SCADA 
system to operate the natural gas storage field including wells, pipelines, gas plant and all other 
associated equipment. 

Therefore Clear Creek failed to develop and use a written alarm management plan as required 
per § 192.631(e).
