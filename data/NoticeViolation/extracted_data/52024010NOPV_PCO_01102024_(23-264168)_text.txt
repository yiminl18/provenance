NOTICE OF PROBABLE VIOLATION 
and 
PROPOSED COMPLIANCE ORDER 

VIA ELECTRONIC MAIL TO: MR.WILLIAM JOHNSON 

January 10, 2024 

Mr. William Johnson 
President 
Phillips 66 Pipeline LLC 
2331 Citywest Blvd. 
Houston, Texas 77042 

Dear Mr. Johnson: 

CPF 5-2024-010-NOPV 

From April 11, 2023 to August 29, 2023 of the on-site inspection, a representative of the Pipeline 
and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), 
pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 United States Code (U.S.C.), inspected your Borger-Chicago 
System in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Missouri and Illinois. As a result of the inspection, it is 
alleged that you have committed probable violations of the Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, 
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The items inspected and the probable violations are: 

1. 

§195.402 Procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies. 

(a) General.  Each operator shall prepare and follow for each pipeline system a 
manual of written procedures for conducting normal operations and maintenance 
activities and handling abnormal operations and emergencies. This manual shall be 
reviewed at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each calendar year, 
and appropriate changes made as necessary to insure that the manual is effective. 
This manual shall be prepared before initial operations of a pipeline system 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
commence, and appropriate parts shall be kept at locations where operations and 
maintenance activities are conducted. 

Phillips 66 (P66) failed to follow its written procedures when conducting normal operations and 
maintenance activities as is required by §195.402. Specifically, P66 failed to follow its 
procedures for conduction atmospheric corrosion inspections. P66’s written procedure: P66-
MPR-6020 – Inspections of Spans and Exposed Piping, Section 7.3.2 states that the inspector is 
required to “Evaluate the condition of the Coating”, with a Good, Fair, and Poor condition 
standard. 

Section 7.5.2 of P66’s procedure also requires the inspector to “Determine the percentage and 
severity of surface rust, if present”. P66’s form GPL-401 which is used to document these 
inspection types is inadequate for the operator to provide detailed documentation, as is required 
by their own procedures. This form, GPL-401, requires only a Yes, No, or NA for corrosion or 
paint deterioration documentation. From reviews of the records, no inspection documented the 
evaluation requirements called out in P66’s written procedures. Therefore, P66 failed to follow 
its written procedures as required by §195.402(a). 

2. 

§195.583 What must I do to monitor atmospheric corrosion control? 

(a) You must inspect each pipeline or portion of pipeline that is exposed to the 
atmosphere for evidence of atmospheric corrosion, as follows: 

If the pipeline is 
located: 

Onshore 

Offshore 

Then the frequency of inspection is: 

At least once every 3 calendar years, but with intervals 
not exceeding 39 months. 

At least once each calendar year, but with intervals not 
exceeding 15 months. 

(b) During inspections you must give particular attention to pipe at soil-to-air 
interfaces, under thermal insulation, under disbonded coatings, at pipe supports, in 
splash zones, at deck penetrations, and in spans over water. 
(c) If you find atmospheric corrosion during an inspection, you must provide 
protection against the corrosion as required by § 195.581. 

P66 failed to inspect its pipeline that is exposed to the atmosphere for evidence of atmospheric 
corrosion as is required by §195.583. Specifically, P66 failed to adequately document the 
inspections and the condition of the pipe found during atmospheric inspections. 

From the review of records, the majority of P66’s atmospheric inspections, recorded on form 
GPL-401 “External Inspection Checklist for Terminal / Station or Valve Site Piping”, failed to 
document beyond the date and location with all data fields marked as “No” or “N/A”. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During the field inspection, there were numerous sections of pipe with observed conditions that 
did not match the corresponding GPL-401 inspection forms in the record. As an example, the 
GPL-401 dated 04/30/2021 for East St. Louis, noted there was no corrosion or paint deterioration 
in the entire facility and PHMSA observed extensive paint deterioration, surface rust, and 
corrosion throughout the facility.  Similarly, the GPL-401’s noted condition(s) for Wichita North 
recorded no corrosion or paint deterioration existed within the facility; PHMSA observed paint 
deterioration and rust in numerous locations within the facility. 

Further demonstrating their insufficiency of records, the operator used a single form to document 
the inspection of 12 exposures across 71 miles. Another form documented the entire East St. 
Louis facility along with manifolds and transfer lines across 25 breakout tanks.  Additionally, the 
records review indicated that multiple GPL-401 forms improperly noted the asset contained 
splash zones or deck penetrations. During the field inspection, no splash zones or deck 
penetrations were observed on the system. 

Therefore, P66 failed to properly inspect its pipeline for evidence of atmospheric corrosion as 
required by §195.583(a). 

3. 

§195.581 Which pipelines must I protect against atmospheric corrosion and what 
coating material may I use? 

(a) You must clean and coat each pipeline or portion of pipeline that is exposed to 
the atmosphere, except pipelines under paragraph (c) of this section. 
(b) Coating material must be suitable for the prevention of atmospheric corrosion. 
(c) Except portions of pipelines in offshore splash zones or soil-to-air interfaces, you 
need not protect against atmospheric corrosion any pipeline for which you 
demonstrate by test, investigation, or experience appropriate to the environment of 
the pipeline that corrosion will-
(1) Only be a light surface oxide; or 
(2) Not affect the safe operation of the pipeline before the next scheduled inspection. 

P66 failed to provide protection against atmospheric corrosion as is required by §195.581. 
Specifically, P66 failed to clean and coat each pipeline that is exposed to the atmosphere. During 
the PHMSA field inspections, it was observed and noted that there were multiple pipe segments 
and appurtenances installed without being cleaned and coated, in several locations. Therefore, 
P66 failed to comply with § 195.581(a) by not cleaning and coating each pipeline or portion of 
the pipeline exposed to the atmosphere. 

Proposed Civil Penalty
