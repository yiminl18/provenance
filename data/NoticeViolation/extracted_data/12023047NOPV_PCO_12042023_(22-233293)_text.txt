Dear Ms. Faraca: 

CPF 1-2023-047-NOPV 

From March 14 to November 3, 2022, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 
Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 
United  States  Code  (U.S.C.)  performed  an  integrated  inspection  of  ANR  Pipeline  Co’s  (ANR) 
inspection  system  #1168  in  various  locations  throughout  Mississippi,  Tennessee,  Arkansas, 
Louisiana and Kentucky. 

As  a  result  of  the  inspection,  it  is  alleged  that  you  have  committed  probable  violations  of  the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The items inspected 
and the probable violations are: 

1. 

§ 192.707 Line markers for mains and transmission lines. 

(a)  Buried  pipelines.  Except  as  provided  in  paragraph  (b)  of  this 
section,  a  line  marker  must  be  placed  and  maintained  as  close  as 
practical over each buried main and transmission line: 

(1) … 
(2) Wherever necessary to identify the location of the transmission 

line or main to reduce the possibility of damage or interference. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ANR failed to place and maintain as close as practical pipeline markers described by § 192.707(d) 
over each buried main and transmission line wherever necessary to identify the location of the 
transmission  line  or  main  to  reduce the  possibility  of  damage  or  interference,  as  required  by  § 
192.707(a)(2). 

During field observation of PHMSA inspection system 1168 between the dates of September 19-
September 30, 2022, PHMSA observed ANR’s pipeline facilities located throughout Kentucky, 
Tennessee, and  Mississippi.    The  bulk  of  the  pipeline  facilities  are  located  below grade  within 
defined  pipeline  right  of  ways  that  contained  one  (1)  to  three  (3)  pipelines.  PHMSA  observed 
multiple  locations  where  ANR  failed  to  follow  the  requirements  of  § 192.707(a)(2).  Specific 
instances of failure for ANR to place pipeline markers as described by § 192.707(d)1  were noted 
as follows in the areas listed below: 

•  PHMSA Inspection Unit 2002, MLV 501-43 Site, located near Dawson Springs, Kentucky: 
During the PHMSA inspection week of 09/19/2022 – 09/23/2022 the PHMSA inspector 
was unable to observe or ascertain the approximate location of the pipeline facilities by 
way of pipeline markers as required by § 192.707(a). The pipeline right of way  stretched 
through  a  clear-cut  section  of  trees  in  an  area  that  was  uncultivated,  and  to  where  no 
hindrances were observed that would make placement of markers impractical to meet the 
requirements of § 192.707(a), and to reduce the possibility of damage or interference as 
required by § 192.707(a)(2). 

•  PHMSA Inspection Unit 1062, MLV 501-30 site, located near Piperton, Tennessee: During 
the  PHMSA  inspection  week  of  09/26/2022  –  09/30/2022,  the  PHMSA  inspector  was 
unable to observe or ascertain the approximate location of the pipeline facilities by way of 
pipeline markers as required by § 192.707(a). The pipeline right of way stretched an area 
to where no hindrances were observed that would make placement of markers impractical 
to  meet  the  requirements  of  § 192.707(a),  and  to  reduce  the  possibility  of  damage  or 
interference as required by § 192.707(a)(2). 

The  PHMSA  inspector  also  observed  on-going  construction  in  an  area  where  it  was 
reported by the operator that there was no one-call placed by the excavator placed with the 
State’s Damage Prevention system, which resulted in construction activities taking place 
across and near the pipelines in an open area where pipeline markers were absent and/or 
the  approximate  location  of  the  pipelines  could  not  be  ascertained  during  unauthorized 
construction  activities.  The  active  construction  equipment  was  observed  crossing  the 

1  § 192.707 Line markers for mains and transmission lines. 
(a) … 
(d) Marker warning. The following must be written legibly on a background of sharply contrasting color on each 
line marker: 
(1) The word "Warning," "Caution," or "Danger" followed by the words "Gas (or name of gas transported) Pipeline" 
all of which, except for markers in heavily developed urban areas, must be in letters at least 1 inch (25 millimeters) 
high with ¼ inch (6.4 millimeters) stroke. 
(2) The name of the operator and telephone number (including area code) where the operator can be reached at all 
times. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pipeline(s) north of MLV 30 setting location with on-going construction that appeared to 
be located to the east of the multi-line pipeline ROW. 

•  PHMSA  Inspection Unit 1052,  Site 1:  ANR  MLV  A501-29 site, located  near Byhalia, 
Mississippi:  During the PHMSA inspection week of 09/26/2022 – 09/30/2022 the pipeline 
right of way stretched through a clear-cut section of trees in an area that was uncultivated, 
and  to  where  no  hindrances  were  observed  that  would  make  placement  of  markers 
impractical to meet the requirements of 192.707(a), and to reduce the possibility of damage 
or interference as required by § 192.707(a)(2). 

•  PHMSA Inspection Unit 1052, Site 2: ANR Valve setting 501- 25 site located near Marks, 
Mississippi: during the week of 09/26/2022 – 09/30/2022.  The PHMSA inspector observed 
a visible clear-cut pipeline ROW when facing south, but no pipeline markers were visible 
through uncultivated lands or at the tree lines where it may be practical to mark the line of 
sight of the pipelines to aid existing damage prevention program. 

Therefore, ANR failed to place line markers wherever necessary to identify the location of the 
transmission  line  or  main  to  reduce  the  possibility  of  damage  or  interference  pursuant  to 
§ 192.707(a)(2). 

2. 

§ 192.731 Compressor stations: Inspection and testing of relief devices. 
(a)    Except  for  rupture  discs,  each  pressure  relieving  device  in  a 
compressor  station  must  be  inspected  and  tested  in  accordance  with 
§§192.739 and 192.743, and must be operated periodically to determine 
that it opens at the correct set pressure. 

ANR  failed  to  test  and  inspect  relief  valves  in  accordance  with  the  interval  prescribed  by 
§§ 192.739(a)2 and 192.743(a)3, as required by § 192.731(a).  Section 192.731(a) requires that “ . 
. .each pressure relieving device in a compressor station must be inspected and tested in accordance 
with §§ 192.739 and 192.743”. Sections 192.739 and 192.743 specify intervals not exceeding 15 
months, but at least once each calendar year, to conduct such inspections and tests.  Specifically, 
ANR failed to test and inspect pressure relieving devices at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but 
at least once each calendar year. 

2 § 192.739 Pressure limiting and regulating stations: Inspection and testing. 
(a)  Each pressure limiting station, relief device (except rupture discs), and Pressure regulating station and its 
equipment must be subjected at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each calendar year, to 
inspections and tests to determine that it is-
(1) In good mechanical condition; 
(2) Adequate from the standpoint of capacity and reliability of operation for the service in which it is employed; 
(3) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, set to control or relieve at the correct pressure consistent with 
the pressure limits of §192.201(a); and 
(4)  Properly installed and protected from dirt, liquids, or other conditions that might prevent proper operation. 

3 §192.743 Pressure limiting and regulating stations: Capacity of relief devices 
(a)  Pressure relief devices at pressure limiting stations and pressure regulating stations must have sufficient capacity 
to protect the facilities to which they are connected. Except as provided in §192.739(b), the capacity must be 
consistent with the pressure limits of §192.201(a). This capacity must be determined at intervals not exceeding 15 
months, but at least once each calendar year, by testing the devices in place or by review and calculations. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During the inspection week of August 15 – 19, 2022, the PHMSA inspector requested pressure 
relief  valve  testing  and  inspection  records  for  safety  relief  valves  located  on  tagged  pipeline 
transmission equipment such as separators, scrubbers, gas line heaters and pulsation bottles.  The 
equipment  being  protected  from  over  pressure  includes  PHMSA-jurisdictional  gas  carrying 
pipeline  facilities  located  at  compressor  stations  subject  to  the  requirements  of  Part  192.    The 
equipment, and respective over pressure protection devices, commonly referred to as thermal relief 
valves, are typically designed and installed to ASME Boiler & Pressure Vessel Code Section VIII 
standards.  PHMSA  received  the  following  records  of  select  relief  valves  and  their  inspection 
dates: 

•  A listing of relief valves located on tagged interstate natural gas transportation equipment. 

The document provided by ANR, dated 10/31/2022, tabulates safety relief valves located on tagged 
equipment  that  can  be  isolated  bottle  tight.    The  table  contains  columns  titled  “Notes”  and 
“Capacity  Notes”  with  details  entered  by  ANR  which  declassify  PHMSA-jurisdictional  relief 
valves4,  thereby  avoiding  the  required  inspection  intervals  prescribed  by  § 192.739(a)  and 
§ 192.743(a), as required by § 192.731(a). 

•  Compressor Station Relief Valve Work Orders. 

A review of this work order list, titled Order Activity Report, dated 10/27/2022, illustrated that the 
following relieving devices described in the “Equipment – Oper” column failed to meet the testing 
and inspection requirements of § 192.731(a): 

•  Equipment – oper 10389992 shows that relieving device 2181-01-PD-02-001was not tested 
and inspected in accordance the schedule prescribed by §§ 192.739(a) and 192.743(a), as 
required by § 192.731(a). An inspection was not performed in 2021. 

•  Equipment – oper 11300399 shows that relieving device Valve Pressure Safety: On the 

Station FG Filter Assembly. Set at 883 psi was not tested and inspected in accordance the 
schedule prescribed by §§ 192.739(a) and 192.743(a), as required by § 192.731(a).  An 
inspection was not performed in 2021. 

•  Equipment – oper 11300480 shows that relieving device Valve Pressure Safety: 30” 

Outlet 2” Relief Separator #3 was not tested and inspected in accordance the schedule 
prescribed by §§ 192.739(a) and 192.743(a), as required by § 192.731(a).  An inspection 
was not performed in 2021. 

Therefore, ANR failed to test and inspect relief valves in accordance with the schedule prescribed 
by § 192.739(a) and §192.743(a), as required by § 192.731(a). 

Proposed Civil Penalty 

Under 49 U.S.C. § 60122 and 49 CFR § 190.223, you are subject to a civil penalty not to exceed 
$257,664 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,576,627 for a related 
series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after March 21, 2022 and before January 6, 
2023, the maximum penalty may not exceed $239,142 per violation per day the violation persists,
