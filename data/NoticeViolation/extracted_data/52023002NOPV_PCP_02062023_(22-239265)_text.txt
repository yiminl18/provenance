NOTICE OF PROBABLE VIOLATION 
and 
PROPOSED CIVIL PENALTY 

VIA ELECTRONIC MAIL TO MR. WARREN CHRISTIAN: 

February 6, 2023 

Mr. Warren Christian 
President 
Mid-Alaska Pipeline, LLC 
615 Bidwell Ave., Suite 100 
Fairbanks, AK 99701 

Dear Mr. Christian: 

CPF 5-2023-002-NOPV 

From September 12 through September 16, 2022, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous 
Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS),  pursuant to Chapter 
601 of 49 United States Code (U.S.C.), inspected your hazardous liquids pipeline system in North 
Pole and Fairbanks, Alaska. 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that you have committed probable violations of the Pipeline 
Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The items inspected and the 
probable violations are: 

1. 

§ 195.452   Pipeline integrity management in high consequence areas.  

(a)  . . . . 
(h)  What actions must an operator take to address integrity issues? - 
(4)  Special requirements for scheduling remediation— 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(i) Immediate repair conditions. An operator's evaluation and remediation schedule must 
provide for immediate repair conditions. To maintain safety, an operator must 
temporarily reduce the operating pressure or shut down the pipeline until the operator 
completes the repair of these conditions. An operator must calculate the temporary 
reduction in operating pressure using the formulas referenced in paragraph (h)(4)(i)(B) 
of this section. If no suitable remaining strength calculation method can be identified, 
an operator must implement a minimum 20 percent or greater operating pressure 
reduction, based on actual operating pressure for two months prior to the date of 
inspection, until the anomaly is repaired. An operator must treat the following 
conditions as immediate repair conditions: 
(C)  A dent located on the top of the pipeline (above the 4 and 8 o'clock positions) that 
has any indication of metal loss, cracking or a stress riser. 

Mid-Alaska Pipeline, LLC (Mid-Alaska) failed to reduce pipeline operating pressure or shut down 
the pipeline after identifying an immediate repair condition. Mid-Alaska’s 14-inch crude oil pipeline 
system is located in a high consequence area and therefore subject to integrity management 
regulations including the specific requirements for scheduling remediation. Per operator records, an 
inline inspection of the 14-inch crude section of the Mid-Alaska Pipeline system was performed on 
May 19, 2022. A report of this inline inspection, dated June 22, 2022, was issued to Mid-Alaska and 
outlined a preliminary finding of a 1.00% depth dent with metal loss located at the 1:00 o’clock 
position. Records indicated that Mid-Alaska directly inspected and repaired the condition on June 25, 
2022. Mid-Alaska pressure records and statements made by operator personnel during the inspection 
revealed that no operating pressure reduction occurred between the time of discovery of the 
immediate repair condition (June 22, 2022), and the time of repair (June 25, 2022). 

2. 

§ 195.579  What must I do to mitigate internal corrosion? 

(a)  . . . .  
(c)  Removing pipe.  Whenever you remove pipe from a pipeline, you must inspect the 
internal surface of the pipe for evidence of corrosion.  If you find internal corrosion 
requiring corrective action under § 195.585, you must investigate circumferentially and 
longitudinally beyond the removed pipe (by visual examination, indirect method, or 
both) to determine whether additional corrosion requiring remedial action exists in the 
vicinity of the removed pipe. 

Mid-Alaska failed to inspect the internal surface of the exposed pipe for evidence of corrosion. The 
operator removed and subsequently replaced four valves at the North Pole Metering section of the 
pipeline in 2020. The valve removal created the opportunity to inspect the internal surface of the pipe 
adjacent to the valve locations for evidence of corrosion. The operator stated that the internal 
condition of the pipe was likely observed during the valve replacement work; however, the operator 
failed to record the inspection of the internal surface of the pipe for corrosion adjacent to the 
locations of the removed valves.  

3. 

§ 195.583   What must I do to monitor atmospheric corrosion control? 

(a)  You must inspect each pipeline or portion of pipeline that is exposed to the  
atmosphere for evidence of atmospheric corrosion, as follows: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
___________________________________________________________________ 

If the pipeline is located 

Then the frequency of inspections is 

___________________________________________________________________ 

Onshore: 

Offshore: 

At least once every 3 calendar years, 
but with intervals not exceeding 39 
months. 

At least once each calendar year, but 
with intervals not exceeding 15 months. 

_____________________________________________________________________ 

Mid-Alaska failed to inspect the PetroStar Metering Inc. Station (PSIMS) portion of their pipeline 
system for atmospheric corrosion at the required intervals.  According to the operator’s inspection 
worksheets, they inspected the PSIMS piping on September 7, 2022, but the operator was unable to 
find a record showing an inspection of the same section of pipe within the prior 39 months. 

The operator presented a 2021 cathodic protection report that stated, “… the above-ground portions 
of the pipeline were visually examined for atmospheric corrosion.” The report gave no additional 
information or results regarding the referenced atmospheric corrosion inspection at PSIMS. The 
report did include the results of visual inspection for atmospheric corrosion of pipe exposed to the 
atmosphere at other locations on the pipeline system. 

Proposed Civil Penalty 

Under 49 U.S.C. § 60122 and 49 CFR § 190.223, you are subject to a civil penalty not to exceed  
$257,664 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,576,627 for a related 
series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after March 21, 2022 and before January 6, 2023, 
the maximum penalty may not exceed $239,142 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a 
maximum of $2,391,412 for a related series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after May 3, 
2021 and before March 21, 2022, the maximum penalty may not exceed $225,134 per violation per 
day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,251,334 for a related series of violations.  For 
violation occurring on or after January 11, 2021 and before May 3, 2021, the maximum penalty may 
not exceed $222,504 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,225,034 for 
a related series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after July 31, 2019 and before January 11, 
2021, the maximum penalty may not exceed $218,647 per violation per day the violation persists, up 
to a maximum of $2,186,465 for a related series of violations.   For violation occurring on or after 
November 27, 2018 and before July 31, 2019, the maximum penalty may not exceed $213,268 per 
violation per day, with a maximum penalty not to exceed $2,132,679.  For violation occurring on or 
after November 2, 2015 and before November 27, 2018, the maximum penalty may not exceed 
$209,002 per violation per day, with a maximum penalty not to exceed $2,090,022.
