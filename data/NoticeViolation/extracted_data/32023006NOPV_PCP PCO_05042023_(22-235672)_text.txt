Dear Mr. Lamp: 

From February 2022 to August 2022, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 
Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 
United States Code (U.S.C.), investigated the February 10, 2022, release of approximately 720 
barrels of crude oil in Cowley County, Kansas, from Coffeyville Resources Crude 
Transportation, LLC’s (CRCT) eight-inch Valley pipeline near CRCT’s, Brothers Station. 

On February 10, 2022, at approximately 11:35 a.m. Central Standard Time (CST), Coffeyville 
Resources Crude Transportation, LLC, confirmed a release from a dead leg connected to their 
eight-inch Valley pipeline in Cowley County, Kansas. A local landowner notified personnel, 
onsite at CRCT’s Brothers Station, of a dark patch of soil on rural farmland near the pipeline’s 
location. 

CRCT dispatched company personnel to the site to shut in the pipeline and investigate, as well 
as, contact their Oil Spill Response Organization (OSRO) contractors to begin cleanup. The dark 
spot was recognized by CRCT personnel as crude oil saturated soil above a dead leg section of 
pipe.  CRCT crews excavated the site of the release and discovered the leak was much larger 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
than previously anticipated and had migrated to a pond on the landowner’s property. CRCT crew 
clamped the leak locations at the six o’clock position on the pipe body using saddle-type clamps. 
Following this accident the dead line was purged, cut, and capped at both ends as a part of 
CRCT’s idling process. Approximately 720 barrels of crude oil were released, but all the crude 
oil was recovered. 

PHMSA deployed an investigator from the Accident Investigation Division (AID) to the scene.  
PHMSA determined, based on CRCT’s Internal Investigation Findings, the direct cause of the 
release to be a through-wall internal corrosion at the six o’clock position at two points on the 
pipe body of a pipeline dead leg. Following analysis of over and short, and control room data, it 
is estimated that the release began on January 26, 2022. This was the first failure on the Valley 
pipeline. CRCT had two previous corrosion failures associated with the Wichita pipeline system 
mainline pipe in 2011 and 2012. 

As a result of the investigation, it is alleged that CRCT has committed a probable violation of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The item investigated 
and the probable violation is: 

1. 

General. If you transport any hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide that would 

§ 195.579 What must I do to mitigate internal corrosion? 
(a) 
corrode the pipeline, you must investigate the corrosive effect of the hazardous 
liquid or carbon dioxide on the pipeline and take adequate steps to mitigate internal 
corrosion. 

CRCT failed to investigate the corrosive effect of the hazardous liquid on its pipeline or 
take adequate steps to mitigate internal corrosion.  During the investigation of the 
February 10, 2022 release, it was found that the leak originated from a dead leg segment 
of pipe that had not been included in the Valley pipeline threat matrix due to ineffective 
internal communications.  CRCT conducts integrity management with a contractor. Its 
integrity management plan regarding internal corrosion identifies dead legs as a unique 
threat. However, CRCT’s Integrity Management Team was not aware that the dead leg 
existed at the failure location prior to the accident and were under the impression that the 
section had been previously idled. Because this segment of the pipe had not been 
included in the threat matrix, CRCT failed to evaluate the pipeline for the risk of internal 
corrosion failure. 

Additionally, CRCT Integrity Management Plan Section 7.3 – Internal Corrosion, 
identifies the threat presented by dead leg pipe sections, stating: 

“COMPANY should develop a procedure to monitor and mitigate 
internal corrosion in these areas.” 

CRCT, however, failed to include the Valley dead leg section in its procedures to monitor 
and mitigate internal corrosion. The failure to comply with § 195.579 resulted in the 
release of approximately 720 barrels of crude oil. CRCT identified internal corrosion 
issues on the pipeline led to metal loss, resulting in two pinhole leaks in the six o’clock 
position of the pipe. Crude would sit idle in the dead leg, increasing the rate of internal 

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
corrosion cell growth. CRCT’s threat matrix states that additional steps would have been 
taken if they had been aware of the dead leg. 

Proposed Civil Penalty
