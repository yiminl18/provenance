Mr. Stanley Horton 
President/CEO 
Boardwalk Petrochemical Pipeline, LLC 
9 Greenway Plaza Suite 2800 
Houston, TX  77036 

Dear Mr. Horton: 

CPF 3-2023-020-NOPV 

From April 4  to July 29, 2022, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety 
Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 
United States Code (U.S.C.), inspected facilities and records of your Boardwalk Petrochemical 
Pipeline, LLC (BPP), ethylene pipeline system in Louisiana and Texas. 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that BPP has committed probable violations of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The items inspected 
and the probable violations are: 

1. 

§ 195.402 Procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies. 

(a)  General. Each operator shall prepare and follow for each pipeline system a 

manual of written procedures for conducting normal operations and 
maintenance activities and handling abnormal operations and emergencies. This 
manual shall be reviewed at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once 
each calendar year, and appropriate changes made as necessary to insure that 
the manual is effective. This manual shall be prepared before initial operations 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
of a pipeline system commence, and appropriate parts shall be kept at locations 
where operations and maintenance activities are conducted. 

Boardwalk Petrochemical Pipeline (BPP) failed to follow its written procedures for 
pipeline repair.  BPP’s O&M Appendix (App) G – Table 3-2 prescribes repair options for 
pipeline defects, and allows repair with a composite sleeve when “damaged material has 
been removed by grinding and removal has been verified by inspection.”  From a review 
of the maintenance records for calendar year 2020, PHMSA found that BPP performed a 
repair on the Highway 13 to Port Barre segment of its BPP-100 pipeline by installing a 
composite sleeve over gouge containing a stress concentrator without grinding the defect 
down to sound metal.  Therefore, BPP failed to follow its written procedures and is in 
violation of § 195.402(a). 

2. 

§ 195.440 Public awareness. 
(a) . . . . 
(b) The operator's program must follow the general program recommendations of 
API RP 1162 and assess the unique attributes and characteristics of the operator's 
pipeline and facilities. 

BPP failed to assess the unique attributes and characteristics of its BPP-100 pipeline 
when identifying the stakeholder audience. Specifically, BPP’s August 2015 plume 
analysis identifies the PIR for BPP-100 pipeline to be 2,030 feet on either side of the 
pipeline based on ethylene.  However, BPP’s public education program communications 
were applied within a coverage area 1,100 feet on each side of the pipeline established by 
the largest potential impact radius (PIR) resulting from a natural gas rupture.  As a result, 
BPP failed to identify additional stakeholders for at least two biennial communication 
cycles prior to the 2022 PHMSA inspection. Therefore, BPP failed to consider the unique 
attributes and characteristics when identifying the stakeholder audience along the entire 
176 mile pipeline. 

During the inspection, BPP amended its public awareness procedures and delivered the 
applicable pipeline information content (mailers) to the newly identified stakeholders. 

3. 

§ 195.452 Pipeline integrity management in high consequence areas. 
(a) . . . . 
(d) When must operators complete baseline assessments? 
(1) . . . . 
(2) Newly identified areas. If an operator obtains information (whether from the 
information analysis required under paragraph (g) of this section, Census Bureau 
maps, or any other source) demonstrating that the area around a pipeline segment 
has changed to meet the definition of a high consequence area (see § 195.450), that 
area must be incorporated into the operator's baseline assessment plan within 1 
year from the date that the information is obtained. An operator must complete the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
baseline assessment of any pipeline segment that could affect a newly identified high 
consequence area within 5 years from the date an operator identifies the area. 

BPP failed to identify areas of population that meet the definition of a high consequence 
area (HCA) and incorporate the pipeline segments into its integrity management baseline 
assessment plan. BPP did not utilize available information from its geographic 
information systems (GIS) as well as other sources including aerial observation from its 
pipeline patrols, and did not adequately perform an information analysis that included the 
populated locations shown below as being High Consequence Areas.  Using aerial 
imagery confirmed by field observations, as well as publicly available information, 
PHMSA identified the populous areas listed in the table below as meeting the definition 
of a HCA.  PHMSA found that the age of the structures indicated that they had been in 
existence for several years, and that the structures were within the potential impact radius 
of the BPP-100 pipeline.  A release of ethylene in these populous areas poses a 
significant threat to the public.  By failing to incorporate these areas as newly identified 
HCAs subject to integrity assessment, BPP is in violation of § 195.452(d)(2).

§ 195.452 Pipeline integrity management in high consequence areas. 
(a)… 
Effective December 1, 2000; 195.452 (j)(2) requires: 
(j) What is a continual process of evaluation and assessment to maintain a pipeline's 
integrity? 
(1)…. 
(2)Evaluation. An operator must conduct a periodic evaluation as frequently as 
needed to assure pipeline integrity. An operator must base the frequency of 
evaluation on risk factors specific to its pipeline, including the factors specified in 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
paragraph (e) of this section. The evaluation must consider the results of the 
baseline and periodic integrity assessments, information analysis (paragraph (g) of 
this section), and decisions about remediation, and preventive and mitigative actions 
(paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section). 

Effective December 1, 2000; 195.452 (j)(2) requires: 
(a) . . . . 
(j) What is a continual process of evaluation and assessment to maintain a pipeline's 
integrity? 
(1)  . . . . 
(2) Verifying covered segments. An operator must verify the risk factors used in 
identifying pipeline segments that could affect a high consequence area on at least 
an annual basis not to exceed 15 months (Appendix C of this part provides 
additional guidance on factors that can influence whether a pipeline segment could 
affect a high consequence area). If a change in circumstance indicates that the prior 
consideration of a risk factor is no longer valid or that an operator should consider 
new risk factors, an operator must perform a new integrity analysis and evaluation 
to establish the endpoints of any previously identified covered segments. The 
integrity analysis and evaluation must include consideration of the results of any 
baseline and periodic integrity assessments (see paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of 
this section), information analyses (see paragraph (g) of this section), and decisions 
about remediation and preventive and mitigative actions (see paragraphs (h) and (i) 
of this section). An operator must complete the first annual verification under this 
paragraph no later than July 1, 2021. 

BPP failed to complete its annual verification of two covered segments.  From a review 
of integrity records, PHMSA identified during the inspection that BPP failed to conduct 
an information analysis on its Enterprise/Motiva-BPP-FAB-168 and Anchorage-BPP-
FAB-160 facilities since BPP purchased the pipeline in November 2014. BPP first 
identified these facilities as located within a high consequence area (HCA) in January 
2016, but had not incorporated them into its integrity management program as covered 
segments.  Additionally, BPP performed an initial but incomplete information analysis on 
these segments in May 2022.  By failing to verify these segments as covered under its 
integrity management program for calendar years 2018 through 2022, BPP is in violation 
of § 195.452(j)(2).
