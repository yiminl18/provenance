Assistant City Manager 
City of Palo Alto 
250 Hamilton Avenue 
Palo Alto, CA 94301 

Dear Mr. Shikada: 

CPF 5-2023-052-NOPV 

On August 15 through 19, 2022, representatives of the California Public Utilities Commission 
(CPUC), on behalf of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), 
pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 United States Code (U.S.C.), inspected the City of Palo Alto 
Utilities (CPA) natural gas distribution system’s damage prevention procedures and records. 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that you have committed probable violations of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The items inspected 
and the probable violations are: 

1. 

§ 192.616 Public awareness. 

(a) … 
(c) The operator must follow the general program recommendations, including 
baseline and supplemental requirements of API RP 1162, unless the operator 
provides justification in its program or procedural manual as to why compliance 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
with all or certain provisions of the recommended practice is not practicable and 
not necessary for safety. 

CPA failed to conduct an annual audit of the Public Awareness Program to measure program 
implementation as required by API RP 1162 Section 8.1  API RP 1162, section 8, paragraph 8.3 
states in part, that the “operator should complete an annual audit or review of whether the 
program has developed and implemented according the to the guidelines in this RP.” However, 
during the inspection, CPA was unable to produce documentation of its annual audit for the years 
2019, 2020 and 2021. 

Therefore, CPA failed to follow the requirements of API RP 1162 as required pursuant to § 
192.616(c).

related series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after March 21, 2022 and before 
January 6, 2023, the maximum penalty may not exceed $239,142 per violation per day the

PROPOSED COMPLIANCE ORDER 

Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 60118, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration 
(PHMSA) proposes to issue to City of Palo Alto (CPA) a Compliance Order incorporating the
following remedial requirements to ensure the compliance of CPA with the pipeline safety
regulations: 

A. 

B. 

In regard to Item 1 of the Notice pertaining to the CPA’s failure to conduct the
required annual Public Awareness Program audits, CPA must amend its 
procedures to provide detailed instructions for conducting and documenting an 
annual audit of the Public Awareness Plan required by Section 8.3 of API RP
1162.  Additionally, CPA must conduct an audit (using the amended procedures)
and submit the amended procedures and audit results to PHMSA within 60 days 
of receipt of the Final Order. 

It is requested (not mandated) that CPA maintain documentation of the safety
improvement costs associated with fulfilling this Compliance Order and submit 
the total to Dustin Hubbard, Director, Western Region, Pipeline and Hazardous
Materials Safety Administration.  It is requested that these costs be reported in 
two categories: 1) total cost associated with preparation/revision of plans,
procedures, studies and analyses, and 2) total cost associated with replacements,
additions and other changes to pipeline infrastructure.
