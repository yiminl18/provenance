NOTICE OF PROBABLE VIOLATION 
and

OVERNIGHT EXPRESS DELIVERY 

June 1, 2023 

Mr. Paul Ruppert 
President and Chief Executive Officer 
Eastern Gas Transmission and Storage, Inc. 
6603 West Broad Street 
Richmond, Virginia 23200 

Dear Mr. Ruppert: 

CPF 1-2023-027-NOPV 

From November 15, 2021, to November 19, 2021, via on-site inspection, representatives of the 
Pipeline  and  Hazardous  Materials  Safety  Administration  (PHMSA),  Office  of  Pipeline  Safety 
(OPS),  pursuant  to  Chapter  601  of  49  United  States  Code  (U.S.C.)  inspected  Eastern  Gas 
Transmission and Storage, Inc.’s (EGT&S) procedures and records for control room management 
of its control room in Bridgeport, West Virginia. 

As  a  result  of  the  inspection,  it  is  alleged  that  you  have  committed  probable  violations  of  the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The items inspected 
and the probable violations are: 

1. 

§ 192.631 Control Room Management. 

(a) … 
(j)  Compliance  and  deviations.  An  operator  must  maintain  for 

review during inspection: 

(1)  Records that demonstrate compliance with the requirements of 

this section; and 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
EGT&S failed to maintain records that demonstrate compliance with § 192.631(h)1.  Specifically, 
EGT&S  failed  to  maintain  documentation  of  a  training  program  for  training  each  controller  to 
carry out their defined roles and responsibilities. 

During the inspection, PHMSA requested documentation of a training program for each controller 
to carry out their roles and responsibilities pursuant to the requirements of § 192.631(h).  EGT&S 
was  unable  to  provide  any  record  of  training  the  controllers  to  carry  out  their  roles  and 
responsibilities.  Additionally,  no  records  were  provided  to  demonstrate  how  controllers  are 
operator qualified for the covered tasks associated with being a controller. 

Therefore,  EGT&S  failed  to  maintain  records  demonstrating  compliance  with  § 192.631(h)  as 
required pursuant to § 192.631(j)(1). 

2. 

§ 192.631 Control Room Management. 

(a) … 
(j)  Compliance  and  deviations.  An  operator  must  maintain  for 

review during inspection: 

(1)  Records that demonstrate compliance with the requirements of 

this section; and 

EGT&S  failed  to  maintain  records  that  demonstrate  compliance  with  § 192.631(f)(2)2. 
Specifically,  EGT&S  failed  to  maintain  documentation  demonstrating  that  field  personnel 
contacted the control room when making field changes that affect control room operations. 

During  the  inspection,  EGT&S  was  asked  to  produce  documentation  of  field  inspections  in 
accordance with EGT&S’s WP071GL-Inspecting, Maintaining & Lubricating Valves pursuant to 
the requirements of § 192.631(f)(2).  During review of the records provided, it was noted that the 
records  did  not  indicate  that  field  personnel  notified  Gas  Control  and  obtained  permission  to 
operate any valve as required by Step 2 of WP071GL. EGT&S’s inspection forms did not contain 
a requirement or data field to document the contacting of the control room before operating any 
valve, which is a field change that affects control room operations pursuant to § 192.631(f)(2). 

Therefore, EGT&S failed to maintain records that demonstrate compliance with § 192.631(f)(2) 
as required pursuant to § 192.631(j)(1). 

Proposed Civil Penalty 

Under 49 U.S.C. § 60122 and 49 CFR § 190.223, you are subject to a civil penalty not to exceed

when making field changes that affect control room operations.
