Dear Mr. Gifford: 

CPF 2-2023-002-NOPV 

From July 19 to July 23, 2021, representatives of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety 
Administration (PHMSA) pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 United States Code (U.S.C.) inspected 
Genesis Pipeline USA, LP (Genesis) procedures and records in a virtual teleconference. 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that Genesis has committed probable violations of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The items inspected 
and the probable violations are: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. 

§ 195.440 Public Awareness 

(a) . . . 
(b) The operator's program must follow the general program recommendations of 
API RP 1162 and assess the unique attributes and characteristics of the operator's 
pipeline and facilities 

Genesis failed to meet the regulation because it did not assess the unique attributes and 
characteristics of its pipeline facilities in its Public Awareness Program baseline message 
brochures provided to the affected public. Specifically, Genesis’ baseline message 
brochures provided to the affected public described natural gas, highly volatile liquids, 
and hazardous liquids. Genesis exclusively transports crude oil in Florida, Alabama, 
Mississippi, and Southeast Louisiana. 

At the time of PHMSA's inspection, the baseline message brochures provided to the 
affected public contained one booklet and one leaflet. The booklet contained a section 
titled "How to recognize a pipeline leak." The referenced section described how to 
recognize pipeline leaks using "sight, sound, and smell" for natural gas, HVLs, and 
hazardous liquids. The only statement regarding hazardous liquids in the referenced 
section was: "Hazardous liquids produce a strong sheen or film standing on a body of 
water." Additionally, the leaflet described "Products Transported in Your Area" and 
specified "Hazardous Liquids [Such as Crude Oil, Diesel Fuel, Jet Fuel, Gasoline, and 
other Refined Products] and Natural Gas.” 

2. 

§ 195.52   Immediate notice of certain accidents. 

(a) . . . 

(d) New information. Within 48 hours after the confirmed discovery of an accident, 
to the extent practicable, an operator must revise or confirm its initial telephonic 
notice required in paragraph (b) of this section with a revised estimate of the 
amount of product released, location of the failure, time of the failure, a revised 
estimate of the number of fatalities and injuries, and all other significant facts that 
are known by the operator that are relevant to the cause of the accident or extent of 
the damages. If there are no changes or revisions to the initial report, the operator 
must confirm the estimates in its initial report. 

Genesis failed to meet the regulation because it did not revise or confirm its initial 
telephonic notice within 48 hours after the confirmed discovery of two accidents in 2018. 
In 2018, Genesis had two reportable accidents that were reported to the National 
Response Center (NRC) as required by § 195.52(a). 

The first accident, Accident Report No. 20180201-30758, occurred on 06/19/2018, with 
the initial telephonic report to the NRC occurring at 16:13 local time, according to Part A 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in the report. Part H of the same report lists a supplemental report date of 08/06/2018, 48 
days after the initial telephonic report to the NRC. 

The second accident, Accident Report No. 20180357-32116, occurred on 10/22/2018, 
with the initial telephonic report to the NRC occurring at 08:54 local time, according to 
Part A in the report. Part H of the same report lists a supplemental report date of 
05/06/2019, 196 days after the initial telephonic report to the NRC.

PROPOSED COMPLIANCE ORDER 

Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 60118, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration 
(PHMSA) proposes to issue to Genesis Pipeline USA, LP (Genesis) a Compliance Order
incorporating the following remedial requirements to ensure the compliance of Genesis Pipeline 
USA, LP with the pipeline safety regulations: 

A. 

In regard to Item 1 of the Notice pertaining to Genesis’ failure to assess the 
unique attributes and characteristics of its pipeline facilities in its Public
Awareness Program baseline message brochures, Genesis must develop and 
distribute to the affected public new baseline message material that adequately
addresses the unique characteristics and attributes of the crude oil transported by 
Genesis. 

B.  Within 90 days of issuance of the Final Order, Genesis must submit to the

Director, Office of Pipeline Safety, PHMSA Southern Region, documentation 
demonstrating satisfactory completion of Item A, including, at a minimum, a copy
of the newly developed baseline message materials. 

C. 

It is requested (not mandated) that Genesis maintain documentation of the safety 
improvement costs associated with fulfilling this Compliance Order and submit 
the total to the Director, Office of Pipeline Safety, PHMSA Southern Region.  It 
is requested that these costs be reported in two categories: 1) total cost associated
with preparation/revision of plans, procedures, studies and analyses, and 2) total
cost associated with replacements, additions and other changes to pipeline 
infrastructure.
