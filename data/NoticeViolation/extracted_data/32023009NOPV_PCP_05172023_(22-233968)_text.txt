Mr. Mark Hewett 
President/CEO 
Northern Natural Gas Company 
1111 S. 103rd Street 
Omaha, NE  68124 

Dear Mr. Hewett: 

CPF 3-2023-009-NOPV 

From February 28, 2022 to September 23, 2022 , a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous 
Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), pursuant to Chapter 
601 of 49 United States Code (U.S.C.), conducted an onsite inspection of Northern Natural Gas 
Company’s (NNG) procedures and records for the Operations and Maintenance (O&M), 
Integrity Management Plan (IMP), and Operator Qualification (OQ) in Nebraska, Iowa, 
Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that NNG has committed probable violations of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The items inspected 
and the probable violations are: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
1.  § 192.467 External corrosion control: Electrical isolation. 

(a) . . . . 
(c) Except for unprotected copper inserted in ferrous pipe, each pipeline must be 
electrically isolated from metallic casings that are a part of the underground system. 
However, if isolation is not achieved because it is impractical, other measures must 
be taken to minimize corrosion of the pipeline inside the casing. 

NNG failed to comply with the regulation because it did not electrically isolate the 
pipeline from metallic casings that are a part of the underground system.  NNG failed to 
provide documentation on why this isolation was not achieved or if it was impractical to 
achieve.  NNG did not provide information that it had taken other measures to minimize 
corrosion inside the casing if isolation was impractical. 

From a review of corrosion control records, PHMSA identified shorted casings for the 
following pipeline segments: 

•  Line 179M471B Test Point 471B.223 - MP 142.00 

Casing tests were conducted on 11/8/1989 and 9/6/2013 and both indicated a 
metallic short. The casing was filled with wax in 2020 as stated during the 
records review.  The casing then was retested on 1/13/2021 and still exhibited a 
metallic short. This was still determined to be a metallic short at the time of 
inspection and no further action was taken by NNG to perform other measures to 
minimize corrosion of the pipeline inside the casing. 

•  Line 179SDB90401 - MP 9.8 

Casing test was conducted on 2/29/2000 and indicated a metallic short. The 
casing was filled with wax and retested on 4/16/2022.  This was still determined 
to be a metallic short at the time of inspection and no further action was taken by 
NNG to perform other measures to minimize corrosion of the pipeline inside the 
casing.  In 2021, the Cathodic Protection reads stated that the casing was clear. 
However the casing was not clear according to the documentation presented to 
PHMSA at the time of inspection.  Remedial action according to NNG’s 
procedure is to be taken. 

•  Line 179SDB91601 - MP 2.65 

Casing test was conducted on 9/6/2005 and repeated on 10/19/2020. The results 
of both indicated a metallic short.  This was still determined to be a metallic short 
at the time of inspection and no further action was taken by NNG to perform 
other measures to minimize corrosion of the pipeline inside the casing. 

Additionally, during the inspection, PHMSA requested a complete list of shorted casings 
for the inspection system, however, the casings listed above were not on the list provided 
to PHMSA by NNG. 

 
   
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  § 192.605  Procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies. 

(a)  General.  Each operator shall prepare and follow for each pipeline, a manual of 
written procedures for conducting operations and maintenance activities and for 
emergency response.  For transmission lines, the manual must also include 
procedures for handling abnormal operations.  This manual must be reviewed and 
updated by the operator at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each 
calendar year.  This manual must be prepared before operations of a pipeline 
system commence.  Appropriate parts of the manual must be kept at locations 
where operations and maintenance activities are conducted. 

NNG failed to follow its own O&M plan from 80.212 Cleaning Pipelines Using Pigs, 
Section 5.1: 

“Where pigging is used to remove liquids on a frequent, periodic basis for internal 
corrosion control or mitigation, document tools used and all findings using the operating 
procedure 80.212a, Appendix A: Routine Pigging Log. Submit logs into the company’s 
records management system. Use the category, pigging log sheets on the Document 
Submittal Form. Retain these records for the life of the facility.” 

During the field inspection of the Redfield Storage area, PHMSA observed that an Excel 
form was utilized for this activity which was not part of the NNG’s procedure.  NNG has 
since modified their procedure to address the use of this form for documenting pigging in 
storage fields.  PHMSA has reviewed the modification to NNG’s procedure after the 
inspection and found it satisfactory. 

3.  § 192.605  Procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies. 

(a)  General.  Each operator shall prepare and follow for each pipeline, a manual of 
written procedures for conducting operations and maintenance activities and for 
emergency response.  For transmission lines, the manual must also include 
procedures for handling abnormal operations.  This manual must be reviewed and 
updated by the operator at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each 
calendar year.  This manual must be prepared before operations of a pipeline 
system commence.  Appropriate parts of the manual must be kept at locations 
where operations and maintenance activities are conducted. 

 
 
   
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
NNG failed to follow their own O&M plan 160.101 Valve Maintenance, Section 5.1.7: 

“If  a  valve  is  found  to  be  in  a  bind,  experiencing  outside  forces,  or  abnormal  loading, 
inoperable, difficult to operate, or doesn't seal, initiate prompt remedial action. Contact the 
manager or team leader to designate an alternative valve that can be utilized to satisfy the 
functions  of  the  inoperable  valve  until  it  is  repaired.  If  repairs  can  be  made  by  field 
personnel during the MCS activity, note the issue and repairs in the comments section of 
the MCS task sheet when completing. If repairs are unsuccessful, note the issue and that it 
was not resolved in the comments section of the MCS task and create an EATS general 
action item and use the list, PLS - Valve Integrity Tracker. Include the valve number, 
pipeline name and a description of the repair required as well as the alternate valve number. 
Tag  the  valve  with  issue  found  and  denote  the  alternate  valve  on  the  tag  as  per  guide 
material in 160.101a.” 

Upon review of the records provided by NNG, PHMSA identified 18 valves that did not 
follow NNG’s Procedure 160.101 Valve Maintenance, Section 5.1.7 as stated above. 

PHMSA requested the MCS task sheets for the inspection system as well as the  PLS – 
Valve Integrity Tracker from their EATS system.  NNG provided the EATS report, PLS 
– Valve Integrity Tracker and a spreadsheet that is maintained by the field which appears 
to be an export from the MCS system with columns added at the end of the report. 

NNG is currently not following their O&M by omitting comments in its MCS system to 
track  deficiencies  and  issues  with  its  valves  and  devices  that  have  been  found  by  field 
personnel  during  inspection.  The  actions  taken  in  the  field  need  to  be  documented  to 
inform  field  personnel  that  there  is  a  potential  issue  with  a  valve  being  inspected,  as 
prescribed by NNG’s O&M procedure 160.101.  The valve spreadsheet entries provided 
by  NNG  do  not  include  comments  corresponding  to  the  issues  identified  in  the  Valve 
Integrity Tracker data. 

4.  § 192.605  Procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies. 

(a)  General.  Each operator shall prepare and follow for each pipeline, a manual of 
written procedures for conducting operations and maintenance activities and for 
emergency response.  For transmission lines, the manual must also include 
procedures for handling abnormal operations.  This manual must be reviewed and 
updated by the operator at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each 
calendar year.  This manual must be prepared before operations of a pipeline 
system commence.  Appropriate parts of the manual must be kept at locations 
where operations and maintenance activities are conducted. 

NNG failed to follow their O&M procedure 080.501 and observe surface conditions over 
its right-of-way when conducting aerial patrols of its pipeline system in this inspection 
system. During the field inspection, PHMSA observed overgrown areas of trees and 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
brush obscuring the aerial view of the right-of-way in multiple locations for this 
inspection system.  No ground patrols were conducted on this inspection system in the 
following three (3) locations: 

1.  Line 11001 MP 6.624 
2.  Line 19901 MP 4.283 East from County Road D 
3.  Line SDB94101, MP 0.93 (Heinrich property) 

Additionally, NNG provided the aerial reports for the inspection system and there was no 
mention of the ROW obstruction in any of the cited areas.  According to their procedure 
080.501 Patrol Program and the 080.501a Appendix A Aerial Patrol Report Form, NNG 
should be reporting these issues from the aerial patrol on the form. Regarding the 
objective of patrolling, it states that: “Observations include looking for leak areas, bank 
erosion or exposed pipeline, brush growing over lines, any unknown encroachment 
activity, or any change in what might be considered the normal appearance for activity 
and land terrain through the pipeline corridor.” 

PHMSA does recognize that NNG has cleared the ROW for the above-cited locations 
after the inspection. 

5. 

§ 192.917 How does an operator identify potential threats to pipeline integrity and 
use the threat identification in its integrity program? 

(a) . . . . 
(c) Risk assessment.  An  operator  must  conduct  a  risk  assessment  that  follows 
ASME/ANSI B31.8S, section 5, and considers the identified threats for each covered 
segment. An operator must use the risk assessment to prioritize the covered segments 
for  the  baseline  and  continual  reassessments  (§§192.919, 192.921, 192.937),  and  to 
determine what additional preventive and mitigative measures are needed (§192.935) 
for the covered segment. 

NNG’s risk assessment program failed to appropriately consider the identified threats for 
each covered segment.  PHMSA reviewed NNG’s risk model and data in regards to 
metallic and electrolytic shorts in casings and NNG failed to incorporate any shorted 
casings into their risk model. 

NNG’s procedure 040.202 Electrical Isolation, section 5.4.3 clearly states that shorted 
casing will be addressed in the risk model.
