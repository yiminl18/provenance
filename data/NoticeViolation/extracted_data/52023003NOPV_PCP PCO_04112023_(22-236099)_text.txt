Mr. Wayne Simmons 
Chief Operating Officer 
Kinder Morgan, LLC 
1001 Louisiana Street 
Houston, TX 77002 

Dear Mr. Simmons: 

CPF 5-2023-003-NOPV 

From October 31, 2022, through November 4, 2022, a representative of the Pipeline and 
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), pursuant 
to Chapter 601 of 49 United States Code (U.S.C.), inspected Kinder Morgan, LLC’s (KM) SFPP 
Pipeline from Long Beach, California to Yuma, Arizona. 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that you have committed a probable violation of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The item inspected 
and, the probable violation is:

§ 195.583  What must I do to monitor atmospheric corrosion control? 

(a)  . . . . 
(c)  If you find atmospheric corrosion during an inspection, you must provide 
protection against the corrosion as required by § 195.581. 

KM failed to protect against atmospheric corrosion as required.  Specifically, during the PHMSA 
field inspection, atmospheric corrosion on LS-120 was identified, at a span crossing Compton 
Creek (MP 1.85), including excessive corrosion with pitting.  LS-120 is a pipeline segment of the 
SFPP that carries product from Watson Station to Colton Station and crosses over Compton 
Creek, which is a tributary that feeds into the Los Angeles River.  This span (Compton Creek 
Span) also has bare pipe at the surface-to-air transition.  After finding atmospheric corrosion 
during the inspection, KM failed to provide protection against corrosion as required by § 
195.581.  Despite the prevalence of atmospheric corrosion on its line, KM failed to adequately 
clean and coat the pipeline pursuant to § 195.581(a).1  Kinder Morgan stated that they were not 
able to perform an atmospheric inspection this past year due to challenges of inspecting that span 
and that they did not have the correct equipment.  This is also demonstrated in the atmospheric 
corrosion record. 

PHMSA identified additional areas of concern in regard to atmospheric corrosion on KM’s SFPP 
pipeline.  Specifically, several areas in Colton Station were found to not be properly 
cleaned/coated and were exposed to the atmosphere.  Colton Station, launcher, and receiver area 
had coating peeling off, minor atmospheric corrosion, and minor pitting.  Breakout Tank C-31 
Valve has disbonded coating and appears to have minor atmospheric corrosion.  PHMSA was 
unable to determine the severity of the atmospheric corrosion on this valve while performing the 
field inspection. This valve is located in a pit, which is a confined space.  Breakout Tank C-29 
Valve has bare pipe with disbonded coating.  PHMSA was unable to determine the severity of 
the atmospheric corrosion on this valve while performing the field inspection.  This valve is also 
located in a pit, which is a confined space.  KM identified Breakout Tank C-29 Valve was 
already marked to be repaired.  KM identified this valve as fair on the 1/28/2020 atmospheric 
corrosion inspection record.  KM identified this valve to have a bare pipe condition on the 
1/14/2021 atmospheric corrosion inspection record, almost a full calendar year after KM 
identified the coating rating to be fair.  At the time of the PHMSA inspection in November 2022, 
the valve still had a bare pipe condition. 

Proposed Civil Penalty 

Under 49 U.S.C. § 60122 and 49 CFR § 190.223, you are subject to a civil penalty not to exceed 
$257,664 per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,576,627 for a series of related 
violations.  For violation occurring on or after March 21, 2022, and before January 6, 2023, the 
maximum penalty may not exceed $239,142 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a 
maximum of $2,391,412 for a related series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after 
May 3, 2021, and before March 21, 2022, the maximum penalty may not exceed $225,134 per 

1 This does not fall within an exception in § 195.581(c) because this is not light surface oxide nor is it corrosion that otherwise 
would not affect the safe operation of the pipeline before the next scheduled inspection. This corrosion impacts the safe operation 
of the pipeline due to its location within a High Consequence Area location, and the pipeline span is located directly over 
Compton Creek, which feeds into the Los Angeles River. 

 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,251,334 for a related series of 
violations.  For violation occurring on or after January 11, 2021, and before May 3, 2021, the 
maximum penalty may not exceed $222,504 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a 
maximum of $2,225,034 for a related series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after 
July 31, 2019, and before January 11, 2021, the maximum penalty may not exceed $218,647 per 
violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,186,465 for a related series of 
violations.  For violation occurring on or after November 27, 2018, and before July 31, 2019, the 
maximum penalty may not exceed $213,268 per violation per day, with a maximum penalty not 
to exceed $2,132,679.  For violation occurring on or after November 2, 2015, and before 
November 27, 2018, the maximum penalty may not exceed $209,002 per violation per day, with 
a maximum penalty not to exceed $2,090,022. 

We have reviewed the circumstances and supporting documentation involved for the above 
probable violation and recommend that you be preliminarily assessed a civil penalty of $81,500 
as follows:

Administration (PHMSA) proposes to issue to Kinder Morgan, LLC a Compliance Order 
incorporating the following remedial requirements to ensure the compliance of Kinder Morgan, 
LLC with the pipeline safety regulations: 

A. 

B. 

In regard to Item 1 of the Notice pertaining to Kinder Morgan failed to adequately 
clean and coat the pipeline pursuant to § 195.581(a), Kinder Morgan, LLC must 
conduct an atmospheric corrosion inspection to include soil to air interface to 
determine the amount of corrosion and then follow their procedures for the proper 
repair method. Due to the location and possible consequences associated with the 
violation, both the assessment and repair shall be done within 60 days of receipt 
of the Final Order. 

It is requested (not mandated) that Kinder Morgan, LLC maintain documentation 
of the safety improvement costs associated with fulfilling this Compliance Order 
and submit the total to Dustin Hubbard, Director, Western Region, Pipeline and 
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.  It is requested that these costs be 
reported in two categories: 1) total cost associated with preparation/revision of
