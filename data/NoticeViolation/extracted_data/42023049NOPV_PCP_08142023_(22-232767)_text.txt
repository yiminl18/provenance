Dear Mr. Bacon: 

From February 7, 2022, through January 30, 2023, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous 
Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), pursuant to Chapter 
601  of  49  United  States  Code  (U.S.C.)  inspected  Dixie  Pipeline  Company  LLC’s  procedures, 
records, and facilities in Apex, North Carolina, Milner, Georgia, and Mont Belvieu, Texas. 

As  a  result  of  the  inspection,  it  is  alleged  that  you  have  committed  probable  violations  of  the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The items inspected 
and the probable violations are: 

1. 

§ 195.583 What must I do to monitor atmospheric corrosion control? 

(a)  You  must  inspect  each pipeline or  portion  of  pipeline  that  is 
exposed  to  the  atmosphere  for  evidence  of  atmospheric  corrosion, as 
follows: 
If the pipeline is 
located: 

Then the frequency of inspection is: 

Onshore 

Offshore 

At least once every 3 calendar years, but with intervals not 
exceeding 39 months 
At least once each calendar year, but with intervals not 
exceeding 15 months 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dixie  failed  to  inspect  portions  of  its  pipeline  system  that  are  exposed  to  the  atmosphere  for 
evidence  of  atmospheric  corrosion  at  least  once  every  3  calendar  years,  but  with  intervals  not 
exceeding 39 months in accordance with § 195.583(a).  Specifically, Dixie failed to inspect the 
exposed pipe at the required intervals at three locations: 124.7008, 133.0786, and 125.0193. 

Location  124.7008  was  inspected  on  April  7,  2015  and  not  again  until  May  17,  2022  during 
PHMSA’s inspection.  Location 133.0786 was last inspected on May 6, 2015.  Location 125.0193 
was last inspected on June 25, 2018. These locations were inspected during the field inspection on 
May 17, 2022. 

Therefore, Dixie failed to inspect portions of its pipeline system that are exposed to the atmosphere 
for evidence of atmospheric corrosion at least once every 3 calendar years, but with intervals not 
exceeding 39 months in accordance with § 195.583(a).
