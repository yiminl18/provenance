Dear Mr. Grubb: 

CPF 2-2023-016-NOPV 

From August 23, 2021 to April 8, 2022, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 
Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 
United States Code (U.S.C.) inspected your written procedures, records, and facilities in 
Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas. 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that you have committed a probable violation of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The item(s) inspected 
and the probable violation(s) are: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
1.  §191.22 National Registry of Pipeline and LNG operators. 

(a)…  

(c) Changes. Each operator of a gas pipeline, gas pipeline facility, underground natural 
gas storage facility, LNG plant, or LNG facility must notify PHMSA electronically 
through the National Registry of Pipeline, Underground Natural Gas Storage Facility, 
and LNG Operators at http://opsweb.phmsa.dot.gov of certain events. 

(1) An operator must notify PHMSA of any of the following events not later than 60 
days before the event occurs: 

(i) Construction or any planned rehabilitation, replacement, modification, upgrade, 
uprate, or update of a facility, other than a section of line pipe, that costs $10 million or 
more. If 60-day notice is not feasible because of an emergency, an operator must notify 
PHMSA as soon as practicable; 

NGPL failed to meet the regulation because it did not notify PHMSA, not later than 60 days 
before construction, of construction or any planned rehabilitation, replacement, 
modification, upgrade, uprate, or update of a facility that costs $10 million or more. 
Specifically, NGPL did not notify PHMSA, at least 60 days prior to construction, of four 
construction projects occurring at compressor stations 301, 303, and 348 between 2018 and 
2020.
