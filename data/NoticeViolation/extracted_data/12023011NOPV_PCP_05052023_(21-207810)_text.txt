Mr. Joseph Sauger 
Senior Vice President of Operations and Engineering 
Buckeye Partners, LP 
One Greenway Plaza, Suite 600 
Houston, Texas 77046 

CPF 1-2023-011-NOPV 

Dear Mr. Sauger: 

From  March  16,  2021  through  May  30,  2021,  a  representative  of  the  Pipeline  and  Hazardous 
Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS),  pursuant to Chapter 
601 of 49 United States Code (U.S.C.) investigated Buckeye Partners, LP’s (Buckeye) in-service, 
rupture in Linden, NJ. 

On  March  16,  2021,  at  5:26  am  Eastern  Standard  Time  (EST),  Buckeye  Line  602  ruptured 
releasing 353 barrels (bbls) of unleaded gasoline into a marsh in Linden, New Jersey. 

As a result of the investigation, it is alleged that you have committed probable violations of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The items investigated 
and the probable violations are: 

1. 

§ 195.452 Pipeline integrity management in high consequence areas. 

(a) … 
(b) What  program  and  practices  must  operators  use  to  manage 
pipeline integrity? Each operator of a pipeline covered by this section 
must: 

(1) … 
(5) Implement and follow the program. 

Buckeye failed to follow its manual of written integrity management procedures. Specifically, 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Buckeye  failed  to  follow  its  Integrity  Management  Program  Manual  –  Appendix  G-11  –  Data 
Integration  Procedure,  dated  05/11/17  (IMP),  regarding  reviews  and  integration  of  data  from 
current and previous ILI results. 

The IMP Section 5.2 stated in part, “Information obtained as a result of the most recent ILI survey 
is correlated with that obtained as a result of the previous ILI survey. Features identified by the 
most recent ILI survey are matched, as best as possible, to those identified  by the previous ILI 
survey. Feature information from the previous ILI survey is incorporated into the pipeline listing 
for the features that were able to be matched…The Event Type, Depth, Length, and Orientation 
are compared for the matched features. Significant changes in depth, length, and orientation are 
identified for further review.” 

The IMP Section 5.3 stated in part, “Joints of pipe with a high density of metal loss features, as 
identified by the most recent ILI survey, are reviewed for the purpose of identifying high density 
areas with a significant change in metal loss density from the previous ILI survey.” 

During the investigation, PHMSA requested ILI records for the 2019 and 2014 runs on line 602. 
Buckeye provided its Baker Hughes Final Inspection Report, dated 11/03/2014 (2014 ILI) and its 
Baker Hughes CPIG In-Line Inspection Final Report, dated 10/28/2019 (2019 ILI). A review of 
the 2014 ILI and 2019 ILI for the joint associated with the Line 602 release revealed that fewer 
anomalies  were  boxed  in  the  2019  ILI  run  than  in  the  2014  ILI  run.  According  to  the  IMP 
procedures,  feature  information  from  the  previous  ILI  survey  is  incorporated  into  the  pipeline 
listing, and significant changes in event type, depth, length, and orientation are identified and noted 
for  further  review.  Thus,  a  reduction  in  boxed  anomalies  should  have  been  noted  for  further 
review1. 

Therefore, Buckeye failed to follow its procedures for reviewing and integrating data from current 
and previous ILI results in accordance with § 195.452(b)(5). 

2. 

§ 195.446 Control room management. 

(a)  General.  This  section  applies  to  each  operator  of  a  pipeline 
facility with a controller working in a control room who monitors and 
controls all or part of a pipeline facility through a SCADA system. Each 
operator  must  have  and  follow  written  control  room  management 
procedures  that  implement  the  requirements  of  this  section.  The 
procedure required by this section must be integrated, as appropriate 
with the operator’s written procedures required by §195.402… 

Buckeye failed to follow its written control room management procedures. Specifically, Buckeye 
failed to follow its Control Room Operating Manual, dated 12/18/19 (CROM) regarding shift change 
documentation in accordance with § 195.446. 

The CROM Section 2.3.1.2 stated in part, “Shared information between Outgoing Controllers and 
Incoming Controllers includes, but is not limited to, the following: Notable incidents, events, or 

1 See also Root Cause Failure Analysis of Line 602 Release (3/16/21) (July 16, 2021) recommendations at 22. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
 
 
 
 
 
 
safety concerns occurring during the shift (information shared via Shift Notes in STAR), Current 
abnormal or emergency situations (information shared via the Pipeline Status in STAR), An Alarm 
review to include active, inhibited, nuisance, off-scan, and recurring/persistent alarms (information 
shared via Desk Log issues in STAR)” 

During  the  investigation,  PHMSA  requested  records  related  to  shift  changes  during  the  event. 
Buckeye provided its Release Shift Change Log, dated 03/16/2021 (Change Log), identified by 
Buckeye as from its STAR system, which documented a 6:00 AM shift change on 3/16/21 for the 
controller responsible for Line 602.  The Change Log failed to demonstrate that any emergencies 
and/or abnormal operating events were communicated as part of the shift change.  The Change 
Log also lacked a ‘Pipeline Status’ field where current abnormal or emergency situations were 
required to be documented per the Section 2.3.1.2 procedure. 

Therefore, Buckeye failed to follow its procedures for shift change documentation in accordance 
with § 195.446. 

3. 

§ 195.446 Control room management. 

(a)  General.  This  section  applies  to  each  operator  of  a  pipeline 
facility with a controller working in a control room who monitors and 
controls all or part of a pipeline facility through a SCADA system. Each 
operator  must  have  and  follow  written  control  room  management 
procedures  that  implement  the  requirements  of  this  section.  The 
procedure required by this section must be integrated, as appropriate 
with the operator’s written procedures required by §195.402… 

Buckeye failed to follow its written control management room procedures. Specifically, Buckeye 
failed  to  follow  its  Operations  and  Maintenance  Manual  Appendix  A  –  Automated  Abnormal 
Operating  Event  Workflow, dated  01/16/17  (O&M),  and  Control  Room  Operating  Manual,  dated 
12/18/19  (CROM),  regarding  investigating  SCADA  indications  of  a  leak  in  accordance  with  § 
195.446. 

The CROM Section 3.2 stated in part, “An AOC is a condition requiring an immediate response 
from  the  Controller  to  prevent  the  shutdown  of  the  pipeline  system.  If  an  abnormal  operating 
condition  is  not  responded  to  and  eliminated  promptly  by  a  Controller,  it  could  result  in  an 
emergency condition…. If one or more of the preceding conditions exist, the Controller should 
take action to identify the cause of the issue(s) and correct the issue(s) in an expedient manner.” 

The CROM Section 3.4.5.2 stated in part, “The procedure following the Unexpected Imbalance 
workflow below provides the steps required by a Controller to address unexpected imbalances. If 
the cause of a leak signature combined with an imbalance alarm cannot be determined within ten 
minutes or less, the Controller takes action to secure the pipeline until an investigation into the 
cause of the alarm is completed.” 

The O&M Section 1 stated in part, “Controllers and Field Operators shall initiate a new Abnormal 
Operating Event (AOE) Workflow for every abnormal operating event that occurs on a Pipeline 
System or Local Facility that is under his/her control. The link to initiate an AOE Workflow is 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
accessible  from  the  Breinigsville  and  Mont  Belvieu  Control  Center  SharePoint  pages.  Field 
Locations can access the link from their respective Asset Team SharePoint Page.” 

During  its  investigation,  PHMSA  requested  the  Supervisory  Control  and  Data  Acquisition 
(SCADA)  event  logs  for  the  day  of  the  event.  Buckeye  provided  its  SCADA  Event  Log,  dated 
03/15/2021  (Event  Log).  Based  on  a  review  of  the  Event  Log  and  additional  investigation, 
Buckeye failed to properly investigate SCADA indications of the leak. The Event Log showed that 
the SCADA provided the controller a high-high flow alarm and then a leak alarm, both of which 
were acknowledged by the controller. The controller’s actions indicate that they believed this was 
a control valve issue and 11 minutes later restarted a small booster pump for about 30 seconds. 
Pressure and flow rates did not appear as they should have for a typical restart and technicians at 
the Linden Station proceeded to investigate a possible control valve issue.  Upon the Control Room 
change over at 6:00 am, the new controller recognized an issue and began providing notifications 
of a possible release. The AOE workflow was not followed until the changeover occurred. 

Following the incident and pursuant to the Corrective Action Order 1-2021-034-CAO, Buckeye 
conducted  a  root  cause  failure  analysis  (RCFA)  of  the  incident.  Based  on  the  determinations 
contained  within  the  RCFA  report,  the  written  control  room  management  procedures  for 
investigating SCADA indications were not followed2. 

Therefore,  Buckeye  failed  to  follow  its  written  control  room  management  procedures  for 
investigating SCADA indications of a leak in accordance with § 195.446(a).
