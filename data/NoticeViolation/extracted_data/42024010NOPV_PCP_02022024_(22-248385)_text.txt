Dear Mr. Ledbetter: 

CPF 4-2024-010-NOPV 

On  August  4,  2022,  a  representative  of  the  Pipeline  and  Hazardous  Materials  Safety 
Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 United 
States  Code  (U.S.C.)  investigated  the  Osage  Pipeline  System  in  Payne  County,  Oklahoma, 
operated by Osage Pipe Line Company, LLC, a subsidiary of Holly Energy Partners, L.P. 

On July 8, 2022, at approximately 12:29 a.m. Central Standard Time (CT), the Osage Pipeline 
System ruptured at MP 6.99 in Payne County, Oklahoma.  Osage discharged an estimated 7,110 
barrels of crude oil onto land belonging to the Sac and Fox Nation.  The crude oil migrated from 
land to Skull Creek, a tributary to the Cimarron River, and traveled 0.75 miles down the creek. 
The crude oil release contaminated soil and surface water and impacted wildlife, including fish, 
birds, and terrestrial animals.1 

As a result of the investigation, it is alleged that you have committed a probable violation of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The item investigated 
and the probable violation is: 

1 As a result of the rupture, PHMSA issued a Notice of Proposed Safety Order which was resolved in a Consent 
Agreement and Order.  See Osage Pipe Line Company, LLC, Consent Agreement and Order, CPF No. 4-2022-055-
NOPSO, 2022 WL 16900267 (Oct. 19, 2022).

§ 195.446 Control room management. 

(a)  General.  This  section  applies  to  each  operator  of  a  pipeline 
facility with a controller working in a control room who monitors and 
controls all or part of a pipeline facility through a SCADA system. Each 
operator  must  have  and  follow  written  control  room  management 
procedures  that  implement  the  requirements  of  this  section.  The 
procedures required by this section must be integrated, as appropriate, 
with  the  operator's  written  procedures  required  by  §  195.402.  An 
operator must develop the procedures no later than August 1, 2011, and 
must  implement  the  procedures  according  to  the  following  schedule. 
The procedures required by paragraphs (b), (c)(5), (d)(2) and (d)(3), (f) 
and (g) of this section must be implemented no later than October 1, 
2011. The procedures required by paragraphs (c)(1) through (4), (d)(1), 
(d)(4), and (e) must be implemented no later than August 1, 2012. The 
training procedures required by paragraph (h) must be implemented 
no  later  than  August  1,  2012,  except  that  any  training  required  by 
another paragraph of this section must be implemented no later than 
the deadline for that paragraph. 

Osage Pipe Line Company, LLC (Osage) failed to follow its written control room management 
procedures in accordance with § 195.446(a).  Specifically, Osage’s controller and control room 
supervisor  attempted  to  restart  a  pipeline  after  receiving  multiple  leak  alarms  before  assuring 
segment integrity and determining if a leak occurred, contrary to Osage’s written control room 
management procedures.  This failure increased the severity of the July 8, 2022, accident. 

At the time of the rupture, the Osage Pipeline System was under the primary control of a controller 
in Artesia, New Mexico.  This location is the Primary Control Center (PCC) for Osage.  Osage’s 
PCC  is  composed  of  five  continuously  monitored  consoles,  and  typically  has  a  Control  Center 
Shift Foreman (CCSF) or Senior Controller (SC) that can monitor all consoles and assumes control 
during controller breaks.  The Osage Pipeline is one of the pipelines that Console 4 is responsible 
for controlling. 

In its Control Room Management Procedure, Revision 11.0, effective 12/20/2021, Osage specified 
the  required  actions  of  a  controller  when  a  leak  is  suspected.    Sections  17.7.1  and  17.9.2  both 
require shut-ins if any condition appears that could indicate a leak, and that the pipeline cannot be 
returned to service until segment integrity is assured and the pressure variance is explained. 

As indicated in the timeline below, beginning at 12:29 a.m. CT on July 8, 2022, the Console 4 
Controller received at least four indications a potential leak had occurred (Potential Indication), 
including  a  detected  loss  of  suction  pressure  at  two  pump  stations  that  caused  an  automatic 
shutdown of the pumps and two leak alarms.  Despite these indications, the Console 4 Controller, 
with CCSF approval, attempted to restart a pump station on the Osage pipeline after the second 
leak alarm without assuring segment integrity and determining the cause of the pressure variance, 
such as by thoroughly investigating line balance, flow trends, rate of change, status of suppliers, 
and other factors associated with pipeline conditions.  After the Console 4 Controller attempted to 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
restart the upstream pump station, a third leak alarm occurred, causing the Console 4 Controller to 
shut down the Osage pipeline.  The attempted restart, prior to assuring segment integrity, increased 
the volume of crude oil released and violated sections 17.7.1 and 17.9.2 of Osage’s control room 
management procedures. 

These failures are detailed in the following timeline: 

•  At 12:19 a.m. CT, the Console 4 Controller logged a regular break.  Shortly after, the CCSF 
became suddenly ill and left the control room without notifying any other controllers that 
were working at other consoles.  As a result, Console 4 was left un-monitored. 

•  At 12:29 a.m., the SCADA system detected a loss of suction pressure at the Cushing PS 
(upstream  PS)  which  caused  an  alarm  (Alarm  1,  Potential  Indication  1)  and  automatic 
shutdown of the pumps.  This alarm went undetected until 12:33 a.m. 

•  At 12:30 a.m., a leak alarm occurred (Leak Alarm 1, Potential Indication 2) followed by 
the automatic shutdown of the Ralston PS (downstream PS) on a loss of suction pressure. 
This alarm went undetected until 12:33 a.m. 

•  At 12:32 a.m., the Hardy PS automatically shut down on a loss of suction pressure.   This 
event was noted in the RCFA but was not listed as an alarm. This event went undetected 
until 12:33 a.m. (Potential Indication 3). 

•  At 12:32 a.m., the initial leak alarm returned to a normal state.2 

•  At 12:33 a.m., upon returning from a scheduled break, a SC at another console noticed 
Console 4 alarms and called upstream supplier checking on their status.  The SC notified 
the supplier to shut down their booster pumps and they complied. 

•  At 12:35 a.m., a second leak alarm occurred (Leak Alarm 2, Potential Indication 4). 

•  At 12:37 a.m., Console 4 Controller and CCSF returned from breaks and were informed of 

the situation. 

•  At 12:38 a.m., Console 4 Controller acknowledged second leak alarm, which returned to a 

normal state. 

2 Although the leak alarm returned to a normal state, that does not mean there is no leak.  The leak detection system 
may determine that conditions are “okay” as a result of the pumps shutting down.  However, Osage’s procedures 
require that leak alarms be presumed actual until proven otherwise.  Therefore, a controller cannot assume a leak is 
not occurring if the leak alarm returned to a normal state as further investigation would be required. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
•  At 12:39 a.m., Console 4 Controller recontacted the upstream supplier asking them about 
a potential tank switch and received verification that there had not been a tank switch.3 
The Console 4 Controller then asked the supplier to restart their booster pump. 

•  At 12:40 a.m., Console 4 Controller and CCSF attempted to restart the Cushing PS.  A 

third leak alarm activated at that time (Leak Alarm 3, Potential Indication 5). 

•  At 12:43 a.m., Console 4 Controller shut down the Osage pipeline and began the line block 

sequence. 

Therefore, Osage failed to follow its written control room management procedures in accordance 
with § 195.446(a).

PENALTY 
$ 239,142 

Response to this Notice 

3  Tank switches can often cause fluctuations in the operating conditions of a pipeline.  Therefore, a tank switch 
could have caused the alarms if the tank switch was not communicated.  Here, the controller contacted the upstream 
supplier to confirm that a tank switch did not occur.
