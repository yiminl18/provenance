Dear Mr. Long: 

CPF 4-2023-052-NOPV 

From  February  28  to  June  24,  2022,  a  representative  of  the  Pipeline  and  Hazardous  Materials 
Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 
United States Code (U.S.C.), inspected Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Company’s (PEPL) natural gas 
pipeline facilities in Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. 

As  a  result  of  the  inspection,  it  is  alleged  that  PEPL  has  committed  probable  violations  of  the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The items inspected 
and the probable violations are: 

 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. 

§  192.605 Procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies. 

(a)  General.  Each  operator  shall  prepare  and  follow  for  each 
pipeline, a manual of written procedures for conducting operations and 
maintenance activities and for emergency response. For transmission 
lines, the manual must also include procedures for handling abnormal 
operations. This manual must be reviewed and updated by the operator 
at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each calendar 
year.  This  manual  must  be  prepared  before  operations  of  a  pipeline 
system  commence.  Appropriate  parts  of  the  manual  must  be  kept  at 
locations where operations and maintenance activities are conducted. 

§ 192.731 Compressor stations: Inspection and testing of relief devices. 

(a)  . . . . 
(b)  Any defective or inadequate equipment found must be promptly 

repaired or replaced. 

PEPL failed to promptly repair or replace defective or inadequate equipment in accordance with 
§  192.731(b)  and  section  of  4.0  of  its  Standard  Operating  Procedure,  Relief  Valves  Testing 
Inspection and Maintenance: M.05 (June 28, 2022).  Specifically, a relief valve 5RV-3S, used for 
secondary overpressure protection (OPP) at the Olpe Compressor, drifted above the set point four 
times  since  2017,  and  PEPL  failed  to  promptly  repair  or  replace  this  defective  and  inadequate 
valve. 

Valve 5RV-3S is a secondary OPP at Olpe Compressor Station on the 300/400 line, and the set 
point is 810 psig or 104% of the Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure (MAOP).  During the 
inspection, PHMSA requested records for relief valve testing inspection and maintenance.  The 
records indicated that the relief valve (5RV-3S) drifted above the overpressure protection pressure 
(OPP)  settings  three  times.  Additionally,  the  valve  was  tested  on  May  5,  2022,  during  the 
inspection and it drifted to 813 psig and was adjusted to 809 psig. 

The May 5, 2022 valve test during the inspection and work orders from 2018, 2020, and 2021 
indicate that this valve drifted above the set point four times. 

Therefore,  PEPL  failed  to  promptly  repair  or  replace  defective  or  inadequate  equipment  in 
accordance  with  §  192.731(b)  and  section  of  4.0  of  its  Standard  Operating  Procedure,  Relief 
Valves Testing Inspection and Maintenance: M.05 (June 28, 2022).

§ 192.905 How does an operator identify a high consequence area? 

(a)  General.  To  determine  which  segments  of  an  operator’s 
transmission pipeline system are covered by this subpart, an operator 
must  identify  the  high  consequence  areas.  An  operator  must  use 
method  (1)  or  (2)  from  the  definition  in  §  192.903  to  identify  a  high 
consequence  area.  An  operator  may  apply  one  method  to  its  entire 
pipeline  system,  or  an  operator  may  apply  one  method  to  individual 
portions  of  the  pipeline  system.  An  operator  must  describe  in  its 
integrity  management  program  which  method  it  is  applying  to  each 
portion of the operator's pipeline system. The description must include 
the  potential  impact  radius  when  utilized  to  establish  a  high 
consequence area. (See appendix E.I. for guidance on identifying high 
consequence areas.) 

(b) 
(1)  Identified sites. An operator must identify an identified site, for 
purposes of this subpart, from information the operator has obtained 
from  routine  operation  and  maintenance  activities  and  from  public 
officials with safety or emergency response or planning responsibilities 
who indicate to the operator that they know of locations that meet the 
identified site criteria.  These public officials could include officials on 
a local emergency planning commission or relevant Native American 
tribal officials. 

PEPL failed to identify a high consequence area in accordance with § 192.905(a). Specifically, 
PEPL failed to identify the Learning Connection Child Development Center (136 Scott Station 
Rd, Jefferson City, MO 65109) adjacent to the Jefferson City pipeline (45-04-001-04) right-of-
way  and  within  its  potential  impact  radius  (PIR)  as  an  “identified  site”  in  accordance  with  § 
192.905(b)(1). 

PEPL  provided  a  map  that  indicated  the  Learning  Connection  Child  Development  Center  was 
within  the  PIR  of  the  Jefferson  City  pipeline.  PHMSA  also  interviewed  the  owner  of  the 
Development Center and received an email with the following information: 

• 

• 
• 

The Development Center building is occupied by 18 employees a day and 65 children 
every working day 
The Development Center’s working days every week is Monday to Friday 
The Development Center is open 52 weeks through the entire year 

Based on information provided by PEPL on the PIR, and owner of the Development Center, it was 
determined that the  Development Center could be  occupied by  more than twenty  (20) or more 
persons  on  at  least  five  (5)  days  a  week  for  ten  (10)  weeks  in  any  twelve  (12)-month  period 
requiring designation as an identified site. 

Therefore, PEPL failed to identify a high consequence area in accordance with § 192.905(a). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. 

§ 192.907 What must an operator do to implement this subpart? 

(a)  General.  No  later  than  December  17,  2004,  an  operator  of  a 
covered pipeline segment must develop and follow a written integrity 
management  program  that  contains  all  the  elements  described  in  § 
192.911  and  that  addresses  the  risks  on  each  covered  transmission 
pipeline  segment.  The  initial  integrity  management  program  must 
consist, at a minimum, of a framework that describes the process for 
implementing  each  program  element,  how  relevant  decisions  will  be 
made and by whom, a time line for completing the work to implement 
the program element, and how information gained from experience will 
be  continuously  incorporated  into  the  program.  The  framework  will 
evolve into a more detailed and comprehensive program. An operator 
must make continual improvements to the program. 

PEPL failed to follow its written integrity management program in accordance with § 192.907(a). 
Specifically, PEPL failed to adequately conduct a preventive and mitigative (P&M) measure study 
for three pipeline segments in accordance with section 9 of its Pipeline Integrity Management Plan 
(Rev. 12; Apr. 1, 2021). 

Section 9 of PEPL’s integrity management program states that, within three years of receipt of 
assessment  data  on  a  pipeline  segment,  the  operator  will  conduct  a  preventive  and  mitigative 
measures  study  of  the  assessed  pipeline  segment.  Section  9.3  requires  PEPL  to  develop 
recommended P&M measures and rank each approved P&M measure. 

PHMSA reviewed Integrity Segment Summary Reports for the following stations and found that 
the undated reports did not clearly identify, develop, and rank P&M measures in accordance with 
section 9.3. 

1.  Centralia 400 Line Station to Pleasant Hill Station (data acceptance date: 10/8/2015) 
2.  Colt Meter (7 Gate) to Louisburg 400 Line (data acceptance date: unknown; ILI run 

performed on 3/23/2017) 

3.  Louisburg 400 Line Station – Houstonia Station (data acceptance date: 12/29/2020) 

Therefore, PEPL failed to follow its written integrity management program in accordance with § 
192.907(a).
