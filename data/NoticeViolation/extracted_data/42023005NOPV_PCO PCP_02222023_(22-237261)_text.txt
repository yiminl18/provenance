Dear Mr. Dunn: 

CPF 4-2023-005-NOPV 

From March 30 to September 6, 2022, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 
Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 
United States Code (U.S.C.), inspected Linde Inc.’s (Linde) hydrogen pipeline system in Louisiana 
and Texas. 

As  a  result  of  the  inspection,  it  is  alleged  that  Linde  has  committed  probable  violations  of  the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.).  The items inspected 
and the probable violations are: 

1.   

§ 191.22 National Registry of Operators. 

(a) …. 
(c) Changes. Each operator of  a gas pipeline, gas  pipeline facility, 
UNGSF, LNG plant, or LNG facility must notify PHMSA electronically 
through 
Operators 
Registry 
at https://portal.phmsa.dot.gov of certain events. 

National 

the 

of 

(1) An operator must notify PHMSA of any of the following events 

not later than 60 days before the event occurs: 

(i) …. 
(ii) Construction of 10 or more miles of a new pipeline; 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Linde  failed  to  notify  PHMSA  of  the  construction  of  10  or  more  miles  of  new  pipeline  in 
accordance  with  §  191.22(c)(1)(ii).    Specifically,  Linde  failed  to  notify  PHMSA  electronically 
through  the  National  Registry  of  Operators  of  approximately  17.39  miles  of  a  new  14-inch 
hydrogen pipeline construction project 60 days before the event occurred. 

During the inspection Linde stated that it began construction on the hydrogen pipeline on March 
15,  2020  and  completed  the  project  on  July  31,  2021.    Linde  failed  to  notify  PHMSA  of  the 
construction project 60 days before the event occurred.  Rather, Linde filed the notification for the 
project on September 9, 2022.  The notification should have been made no later than January 15, 
2020. 

Therefore, Linde failed to notify PHMSA of the construction of 10 or more miles of new pipeline 
in accordance with § 191.22(c)(1)(ii). 

2.   

§ 192.459 External corrosion control: Examination of buried pipeline when exposed. 

external 

corrosion 

Whenever an operator has knowledge that any portion of a buried 
pipeline is exposed, the exposed portion must be examined for evidence 
of external corrosion if the pipe is bare, or if the coating is deteriorated. 
remedial  action  under §§ 
If 
192.483 through 192.489 is  found,  the  operator  shall 
investigate 
circumferentially  and  longitudinally  beyond  the  exposed  portion  (by 
visual  examination,  indirect  method,  or  both)  to  determine  whether 
additional corrosion requiring remedial action exists in the vicinity of 
the exposed portion. 

requiring 

Linde  failed  to  examine  two  exposed  portions  of  buried  pipelines  for  evidence  of  external 
corrosion in accordance with § 192.459.  Specifically, Linde failed to perform a visual examination 
on two (2) of the five (5) replacements/repairs of exposed buried pipeline (the LA-TX Hydrogen 
Pipeline System) for evidence of deteriorated coating and/or external corrosion. 

During the inspection Linde failed to provide Exposure Report Forms SMP-189 or any records 
showing an internal/external corrosion examination or visual examinations of the coating on the 
exposed portions of the pipe when exposed for the following two projects: 1) Sens Road Relocation 
Project in LaPorte, Texas (2019) and 2) Line Lowering project in Texas City, Texas (2020). 

Therefore,  Linde  failed  to  examine  two  exposed  portions  of  buried  pipelines  for  evidence  of 
external corrosion in accordance with § 192.459. 

3. 

§ 192.937 What is a continual process of evaluation and assessment to maintain a 
pipeline's integrity? 

(a) . . . . 
(b) Evaluation. An operator must conduct a periodic evaluation as 
frequently as needed to assure the integrity of each covered segment. 
The periodic evaluation must be based on a data integration and risk 
assessment of the entire pipeline as specified in § 192.917. For plastic 
transmission pipelines, the  periodic evaluation is  based on the  threat 

 
 
 
  
 
 
   
 
analysis  specified  in  192.917(d).  For  all  other  transmission  pipelines, 
the evaluation must consider the past and present integrity assessment 
results, data integration and risk assessment information (§ 192.917), 
and decisions about remediation (§ 192.933) and additional preventive 
and  mitigative  actions  (§  192.935).  An  operator  must  use  the  results 
from  this  evaluation  to  identify  the  threats  specific  to  each  covered 
segment and the risk represented by these threats. 

Linde failed to conduct a periodic evaluation as frequently as needed to assure the integrity of each 
covered segment in accordance with § 192.937(b).  Specifically, Linde failed to conduct a risk 
analysis of its pipeline to identify additional preventive and mitigative actions after constructing 
seventeen  miles  of  covered  segments.    In  addition,  Linde’s  procedures  failed  to  include  a 
requirement to conduct a periodic evaluation as frequently as needed to assure the integrity of each 
covered segment in accordance with § 192.937(b). 

Linde has not conducted a risk analysis since 2010.  Therefore, Linde must conduct a risk analysis 
to determine if additional preventive and mitigative actions, including automatic shut-off valves 
or  remote  control  valves,  would  mitigate  or  enhance  public  safety  for  its  covered  segments, 
including  the  newly-constructed  segments.    Linde  must  also  revise  its  procedures  to  include  a 
requirement to conduct a periodic evaluation, at a specified interval, to assure the integrity of each 
covered segment in accordance with § 192.937(b).  

Therefore,  Linde  failed  to  conduct  a  periodic  evaluation  as  frequently  as  needed  to  assure  the 
integrity of each covered segment in accordance with § 192.937(b).

PROPOSED COMPLIANCE ORDER 

Pursuant  to  49  U.S.C.  §  60118,  the  Pipeline  and  Hazardous  Materials  Safety  Administration 
(PHMSA)  proposes  to  issue  to  Linde,  Inc.  a  Compliance  Order  incorporating  the  following 
remedial requirements to ensure compliance with the pipeline safety regulations: 

A. 

In regard to Item 3 of the Notice pertaining to Linde’s failure to conduct a 
periodic evaluation as frequently as needed to assure the integrity of each 
covered segment, Linde must conduct a risk analysis and submit the analysis 
to the Director, Southwest Region within 60 days of issuance of the Final 
Order.  Linde must also revise its procedures to include a requirement to 
conduct a periodic evaluation, at a specified interval, to assure the integrity 
of each covered segment and submit the revised procedures to the Director, 
Southwest Region within 60 days of issuance of the Final Order. 

It is requested (not mandated) that Linde, Inc. maintain documentation of the safety improvement 
costs  associated  with  fulfilling  this  Compliance  Order  and  submit  the  total  to  Bryan  Lethcoe, 
Director,  Southwest  Region,  Pipeline  and  Hazardous  Materials  Safety  Administration.    It  is 
requested  that  these  costs  be  reported  in  two  categories:  1)  total  cost  associated  with  the 
preparation/revision of plans, procedures, studies, and analyses, and 2) the total cost associated 
with replacements, additions, and other changes to pipeline infrastructure.
