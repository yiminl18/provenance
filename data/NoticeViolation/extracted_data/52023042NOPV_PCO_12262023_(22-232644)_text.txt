and 
PROPOSED COMPLIANCE ORDER 

VIA ELECTRONIC MAIL TO: Martyn.Willsher@amplifyenergy.com 

December 26, 2023 

Mr. Martyn Willsher 
President and Chief Executive Officer 
Amplify Energy Corp. 
111 Ocean Boulevard, Suite 1240 
Long Beach, CA 90802 

Dear Mr. Willsher: 

CPF 5-2023-042-NOPV 

From November 28 through December 2, 2022, representatives of the Pipeline and Hazardous 
Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 United States Code, 
inspected Amplify Energy’s Beta Offshore procedures (Beta) and records for control room 
management in Long Beach, California. 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that you have committed probable violations of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The items inspected 
and the probable violations are: 

1. 

§195.446  Control room management. 

(a) … 
(c) Provide adequate information. Each operator must provide its controllers with 
the information, tools, processes, and procedures necessary for the controllers to 
carry out the roles and responsibilities the operator has defined by performing each 
of the following: 

 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1) … 
(3) Test and verify an internal communication plan to provide adequate means for 
manual operation of the pipeline safely, at least once each calendar year, but at 
intervals not to exceed 15 months; 

Beta failed to test and verify its internal communication plan as required. Specifically, during 
inspection, Beta failed to provide records demonstrating that Beta had tested and verified its 
internal communications plan at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15 
months, as required by Pipeline Specific Operations and Maintenance Section 19 Control Room 
Management Rev#20014-1 subsection 404 Internal Communications Plan.  Beta failed to test its 
Internal Communications Plan for the calendar years of 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022. 

Therefore, Beta failed to test and verify its internal communication plan as required pursuant to § 
195.446(c)(3). 

2. 

§195.446  Control room management. 

(a) … 
(c) Provide adequate information. Each operator must provide its controllers with 
the information, tools, processes, and procedures necessary for the controllers to 
carry out the roles and responsibilities the operator has defined by performing each 
of the following: 
(1) … 
(4) Test any backup SCADA systems at least once each calendar year, but at 
intervals not to exceed 15 months; 

Beta failed to test its backup SCADA systems as required. Specifically, during the inspection, 
Beta could not provide records to demonstrate that Beta has tested its backup SCADA systems at 
least once each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15 months1for the calendar years of 
2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022. 

Therefore, Beta failed to test its backup SCADA as required pursuant to § 195.446(c)(4). 

3. 

§195.446  Control room management. 

(a) … 
(e) Alarm management. Each operator using a SCADA system must have a written 
alarm management plan to provide for effective controller response to alarms. An 
operator's plan must include provisions to: 
(1) … 
(3) Verify the correct safety-related alarm set-point values and alarm descriptions 
when associated field instruments are calibrated or changed and at least once each 
calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15 months; 

1 Beta has two control rooms, Beta Station and Platform Elly.  The Elly CRM is the operational back up for Beta 
Station.  Elly has no back up control room. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
   
Beta failed to verify the correct safety-related alarm set-point values and alarm descriptions 
when associated field instruments are calibrated or changed and at least once each calendar year, 
but at intervals not to exceed 15 months, as required.  Specifically, a review of Beta’s records 
during the inspection revealed that the 2019 and  2020 reviews of safety-related alarm set-point 
values and alarm descriptions exceeded the 15-month maximum review interval as the 2019 
review was dated May 19, 2019, and the 2020 review was dated September 20, 2020. 

Therefore, Beta failed to verify safety-related alarm set point values and alarm descriptions when 
associated field instruments are calibrated or changed at least once each calendar year, at 
intervals not to exceed 15 months as required pursuant to § 195.446(e)(3). 

4. 

§195.446  Control room management. 

(a) … 
(e) Alarm management. Each operator using a SCADA system must have a written 
alarm management plan to provide for effective controller response to alarms. An 
operator's plan must include provisions to: 
(1) … 
(4) Review the alarm management plan required by this paragraph at least once 
each calendar year, but at intervals not exceeding 15 months, to determine the 
effectiveness of the plan; 

Beta failed to conduct a review of the alarm management plan at least once each calendar year, 
but at intervals not exceeding 15 months, to determine the effectiveness of the plan, as required. 
Specifically, during the inspection, Beta could not provide any documentation demonstrating a 
review of its alarm management plan. 

Therefore, Beta failed to conduct a review of its alarm management plan at least once a calendar 
year, at intervals not to exceed 15 months as required per § 195.446(e)(4).

the following remedial requirements to ensure the compliance of Amplify Energy’s Beta
Offshore (Beta) with the pipeline safety regulations: 

A. 

B. 

C. 

D. 

In regard to Item 1 of the Notice pertaining to Beta’s failure to test and verify its
internal communications plan at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not
to exceed 15 months, Beta must amend its internal communications plan to
provide detailed instructions for the implementation, testing, and recording of
plan tests and conduct testing and verification of the amended internal
communications plan.  Beta must submit to PHMSA the amended internal 
communications plan and records to show that the amended internal
communications plan has been tested within 120 days of receipt of the Final 
Order. 

In regard to Item 2 of the Notice pertaining to Beta’s failure to test its backup
SCADA systems at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15
months, Beta must amend its procedure to include detailed instructions on how to
conduct and document a test of the backup SCADA systems.  In addition, Beta 
must conduct testing of its backup SCADA system using the amended procedure. 
Beta must submit a copy to PHMSA of the amended procedure and records to 
show that the backup SCADA system has been tested within 120 days of receipt 
of the Final Order. 

In regard to Item 4 of the Notice pertaining to Beta failed to conduct a review of

using the amended procedure. Beta must submit to PHMSA a copy of the
amended procedure and records to demonstrate that the Alarm Management Plan
has been reviewed using the amended procedure within 120 days of receipt of the 
Final Order. 

It is requested (not mandated) that Beta maintain documentation of the safety 
improvement costs associated with fulfilling this Compliance Order and submit 
the total to Dustin Hubbard, Director, Western Region, Pipeline and Hazardous
Materials Safety Administration.  It is requested that these costs be reported in
two categories: 1) total cost associated with preparation/revision of plans,
procedures, studies and analyses, and 2) total cost associated with replacements,
additions and other changes to pipeline infrastructure.
