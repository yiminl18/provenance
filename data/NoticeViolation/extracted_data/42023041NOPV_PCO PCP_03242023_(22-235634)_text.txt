Michael Jennings 
President, Holly Energy Partners 
Holly Energy Partners – Operating, L.P. 
2828 N. Harwood Street 
Suite 1300 
Dallas Texas 75201 

Dear Mr. Jennings: 

CPF 4-2023-041-NOPV 

From February 28 to December 7, 2022, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 
Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 
United  States  Code  (U.S.C.)  inspected  the  following  Holly  Energy  Partners  –  Operating,  L.P. 
(Holly)  assets:  Osage  Pipeline  Company,  LLC  in  Oklahoma,  and  Kansas;  El  Dorado  Tanks  in 
Kansas; and UNEV Pipeline, LLC in Nevada, and Utah.   

As a result of the  inspection, it is alleged that Holly has committed a probable violation of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The item inspected and 
the probable violation is: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
1. 

§ 195.583 What must I do to monitor atmospheric corrosion control? 

(a) You must inspect each pipeline or portion of pipeline that is 
exposed  to  the  atmosphere  for  evidence  of  atmospheric  corrosion,  as 
follows: 

(b) During inspections you must give particular attention to pipe at 
soil-to-air  interfaces,  under  thermal  insulation,  under  disbonded 
coatings, at pipe supports, in splash zones, at deck penetrations, and in 
spans over water.  

Holly failed to inspect each pipeline or portion of the pipeline that is exposed to the atmosphere 
for evidence of atmospheric corrosion at least once every 3 calendar years, but with intervals not 
exceeding 39 months, paying particular attention to pipe under thermal insulation in accordance 
with  §  195.583(a)  and  (b)  and  its  procedures:  EP  21-7-1  Atmospheric  Corrosion  Monitoring, 
Inspection, and Mitigation Procedure, dated  06/01/2021.  Specifically, Holly  failed to  conduct 
adequate atmospheric corrosion control inspections in 2017 and 2020 because it failed to install 
access plug flanges (APFs) for corrosion monitoring locations and failed to remove the thermal 
insulation to conduct its inspections. 

Holly’s  atmospheric  corrosion  control  procedure  requires  installation  of  inspection  access  plug 
flanges (APFs) for corrosion monitoring locations.  The APFs should be 2.5 inches in diameter 
with silicone rubber plugs to allow for inspection of the pipe within the thermal insulation.    During 
the field inspection for the Osage Pipeline, PHMSA observed a receiver in El Dorado, Kansas that 
was enclosed in thermal insulation with jacketing installed from the mainline receiver isolation 
valve to the trap door.  PHMSA could not identify any APFs allowing for inspection of the pipe 
or  any  corrosion  monitoring  locations.    Without  any  APFs,  the  pipe  cannot  be  inspected  for 
corrosion due to the thermal insulation. 

As indicated in the atmospheric corrosion inspection records for 2017 and 2020, Holly failed to 
remove the thermal insulation to inspect the pipe, as required by § 195.583(b).  Therefore, the pipe 
under  the  thermal  insulation  was  not  inspected  in  2017  and  2020,  and  the  inspection  interval 
exceeded the 39-month requirement. 

This is a repeat of a violation in CPF 4-2018-5005, Item #7. 

Therefore, Holly failed to inspect each pipeline or portion of the pipeline that is exposed to the 
atmosphere for evidence of atmospheric corrosion at least once every 3 calendar years, but with 

If the pipeline is located:Then the frequency of inspection is:OnshoreAt least once every 3 calendar years, but with intervals not exceeding 39 months.OffshoreAt least once each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 15 months. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
intervals not exceeding 39 months, paying particular attention to pipe under thermal insulation in 
accordance with § 195.583(a) and (b) and its procedures. 

Proposed Civil Penalty 

Under 49 U.S.C. § 60122 and 49 CFR § 190.223, you are subject to a civil penalty not to exceed 
$257,664 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,576,627 for a related 
series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after March 21, 2022 and before January 6, 
2023, the maximum penalty may not exceed $239,142 per violation per day the violation persists, 
up to a maximum of $2,391,412 for a related series of violations.  For violation occurring on or 
after May 3, 2021 and before March 21, 2022, the maximum penalty may not exceed $225,134 
per violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,251,334 for a related series of 
violations.    For  violation  occurring  on  or  after  January  11,  2021  and  before  May  3,  2021,  the 
maximum penalty may not exceed $222,504 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a 
maximum of $2,225,034 for a related series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after July 
31,  2019  and  before  January  11,  2021,  the  maximum  penalty  may  not  exceed  $218,647  per 
violation  per  day  the  violation  persists,  up  to  a  maximum  of  $2,186,465  for  a related  series  of 
violations.  For violation occurring on or after November 27, 2018 and before July 31, 2019, the 
maximum penalty may not exceed $213,268 per violation per day, with a maximum penalty not to 
exceed $2,132,679.  For violation occurring on or after November 2, 2015 and before November 
27, 2018, the maximum penalty may not exceed $209,002 per violation per day, with a maximum 
penalty not to exceed $2,090,022. 

We  have  reviewed  the  circumstances  and  supporting  documentation  involved  for  the  above 
probable violations and recommend that you be preliminarily assessed a civil penalty of $108,700 
as follows:

PROPOSED COMPLIANCE ORDER 

Pursuant  to  49  United  States  Code  §  60118,  the  Pipeline  and  Hazardous  Materials  Safety 
Administration (PHMSA) proposes to issue to Holly Energy Partners (Holly) a Compliance Order 
incorporating  the  following  remedial  requirements  to  ensure  the  compliance  of  Holly  Energy 
Partners with the pipeline safety regulations: 

A. 

B. 

In  regard  to  Item  1  of  the  Notice  pertaining  to  Holly’s  failure  to  inspect  each 
pipeline or portion of pipeline that is exposed to the atmosphere for evidence of 
atmospheric corrosion at least once every 3 calendar years, but with intervals not 
exceeding 39 months, paying particular attention to pipe under thermal insulation, 
Holly must identify all jurisdictional pipelines with thermal insulation.  If access 
plug flanges (APFs) are installed, Holly must provide PHMSA with pictures of the 
APFs and the last two cycles of atmospheric corrosion inspections that specifically 
detail the condition of the pipe underneath the thermal insulation.  If APFs are not 
installed, Holly must follow its procedure and install APFs at identified corrosion 
monitoring  locations.    After  installation  of  the  APFs,  Holly  must  conduct 
atmospheric  corrosion  inspections  of  those  pipelines  and  provide  those  records, 
including APF installation records and pictures, to the Director, Southwest Region, 
PHMSA within 120 days of issuance of the Final Order. 

It  is requested (not mandated) that Holly Energy Partners maintain documentation 
of the safety improvement costs associated with fulfilling this Compliance Order 
and submit the total to Bryan Lethcoe, Director, Southwest Region, Pipeline and 
Hazardous  Materials  Safety  Administration.    It  is  requested  that  these  costs  be 
reported  in  two  categories:  1)  total  cost  associated  with  preparation/revision  of 
plans,  procedures,  studies  and  analyses,  and  2)  total  cost  associated  with 
replacements, additions and other changes to pipeline infrastructure.
