Mr. Mark Hewett 
President & CEO 
Northern Natural Gas Company 
1111 S. 103rd Street 
Omaha, NE 68124 

Dear Mr. Hewett: 

CPF 3-2024-012-NOPV 

From April 10 through May 4, 2023, representatives of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 
Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), along with representatives 
from the Michigan Public Service Commission, Minnesota Office of Pipeline Safety, and the 
Iowa Utility Board acting as Interstate Agents, pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 United States Code 
(U.S.C.) inspected Northern Natural Gas Company’s (NNG) procedures and records for the new 
gas integrity rule1 in Omaha, Nebraska. 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that you have committed probable violations of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The items inspected 
and the probable violations are: 

1 Docket No. PHMSA–2011–0023; Amdt. Nos. 191–26; 192–125 Pipeline Safety: Safety of Gas Transmission 
Pipelines: MAOP Reconfirmation, Expansion of Assessment Requirements, and Other Related Amendments 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. 

§ 192.5 Class locations. 
(a) . . . . 
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, pipeline locations are 
classified as follows: 
(1) . . . . 
(3) A Class 3 location is: 
(i) . . . . 
(ii) An area where the pipeline lies within 100 yards (91 meters) of either a building 
or a small, well defined outside area (such as a playground, recreation area, outdoor 
theater, or other place of public assembly) that is occupied by 20 or more persons on 
at least 5 days a week for 10 weeks in any 12-month period. (The days and weeks 
need not be consecutive.) 

NNG did not properly identify several locations where a building or well defined outside 
area was occupied by 20 or more persons on at least 5 days a week for 10 weeks in any 
12-month period, per § 192.5(b)(3). Specifically, NNG’s Engineering Standard (ES) 
0060, referenced within NNG’s procedure 80.101 – Class Locations, stated that identified 
sites for class location must have people at the location for at least 4 hours in a 24-hour 
period. § 192.5(b)(3) does not specify a length of time the location must be occupied 
during the day. As a result, NNG misidentified multiple sites. The misidentified sites 
discovered during PHMSA’s inspection were as follows: 

Location 
•  Sartell, MN 
•  Houghton, MI 
•  Mankato, MN 

Coordinates 
Lat 45.603886; Long -94.232211 
Lat 47.110667; Long -88.558172  MI Technical College 
Lat 44.185483; Long -93.935983 

Additional Note: 
First Methodist Church 

FedEx Ground Building 

Shortly after the inspection, NNG indicated that they re-visited these locations and 
verified that these areas did meet the occupation requirements in accordance with § 
192.5(b)(3). 

Additionally, the FedEx in Mankato, Minnesota, location was an identified site, but NNG 
incorrectly classed the relevant section of pipe as a Class 2 area. NNG reclassed the 
location to a Class 3 after the inspection. 

By failing to properly identify these three locations as Class 3 locations, NNG did not 
meet the requirements of § 192.5(b)(3). 

2. 

§ 192.605 Procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies. 
(a) General. Each operator shall prepare and follow for each pipeline, a manual of 
written procedures for conducting operations and maintenance activities and for 
emergency response. For transmission lines, the manual must also include 
procedures for handling abnormal operations. This manual must be reviewed and 
updated by the operator at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each 
calendar year. This manual must be prepared before operations of a pipeline system 
commence. Appropriate parts of the manual must be kept at locations where 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
operations and maintenance activities are conducted. 

NNG did not follow its manual of written procedures in accordance with § 192.605(a). 
Specifically, NNG did not follow procedure 140.101, entitled Identification of High 
Consequence Areas (HCA) and Moderate Consequence Areas (MCA), section 3.11.3. 
Section 3.11.3 stated that “[f]or MCAs, Class 3 and 4 locations, the baseline assessment 
plan is documented in operating procedure 140.401b, Baseline Assessment Plan Outside 
of HCAs. The initial MCA analysis on pipe segments with an MAOP greater than or 
equal to 30% SMYS must be completed no later than July 1, 2021.” 

During PHMSA’s inspection, PHMSA inspectors reviewed NNG’s pipeline system for 
MCAs and determined that four MCAs were missed. As a result, NNG did not complete 
an initial MCA analysis for the baseline assessment plan for the four missed MCAs. The 
missed MCAs discovered during PHMSA’s inspection were as follows: 

Location 

•  Sauk Rapids, MN 
•  Sartell, MN 
•  Sartell, MN 
•  Sartell, MN 

Coordinates 
Lat 45.597242, Long -94.126919 
Lat 45.598406, Long -94.23635 
Lat 45.619344, Long -94.188419 
Lat 45.601144, Long 094.234033 

3. 

§ 192.710 Transmission lines: Assessments outside of high consequence areas. 
(a) …. 
(b) General – 
(1) Initial assessment. An operator must perform initial assessments in accordance 
with this section based on a risk-based prioritization schedule and complete initial 
assessment for all applicable pipeline segments no later than July 3, 2034, or as soon 
as practicable but not to exceed 10 years after the pipeline segment first meets the 
conditions of § 192.710(a) (e.g., due to a change in class location or the area becomes 
a moderate consequence area), whichever is later. 

NNG’s MCA Baseline Assessment schedule did not adequately reflect NNG’s evaluated 
risk ranking for assessments of the MCA segments. Specifically, NNG's baseline 
assessment schedule for MCAs had multiple instances where NNG scheduled an MCA 
segment with a relatively higher risk per the risk model to be assessed after an MCA 
segment with a relatively lower risk. For example, MCA 21-M470B-01 was risked 
ranked in 2021 as a 7 and scheduled to be assessed in 2027 while MCA 21-M471B-12 
was risked ranked in 2021 as a 13, but was scheduled to be baseline assessed in 2025. 
Another example is MCA 21-M440B-05, which was risk ranked in 2021 as a 10 and 
scheduled to be assessed in 2028; while MCA 21-M500B-04 was risk ranked in 2021 as a 
125 and scheduled to be assessed in 2025. 

During PHMSA’s inspection, NNG personnel indicated to PHMSA inspectors that the 
baseline assessment scheduling was largely created to match NNG’s existing scheduling 
of the line segments within the integrity management program; however, NNG did not 
document this reasoning. NNG should be documenting every decision made with regards 

 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to the integrity program. Additionally, FAQ 66 for the Gas Transmission Rule provides 
more guidance on the expectations of an operator when the assessment schedule does not 
match the risk rank prioritization schedule. 

By creating an assessment schedule that did not match its determination of risk rank 
prioritization, NNG did not meet the requirements of § 192.710(b).

PROPOSED COMPLIANCE ORDER 

Pursuant to 49 United States Code § 60118, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety 
Administration (PHMSA) proposes to issue to NNG a Compliance Order incorporating the
following remedial requirements to ensure the compliance of NNG with the pipeline safety 
regulations: 

A. 

In regard to Item 1 of the Notice pertaining to the missed identified sites for Class 
3 locations, NNG must do the following: 

•  Revise Procedure 80.101 and Engineering Standard 0060 to remove the 4 
hour time limit and submit a copy to the Director Central Region within 
90 days of the date of the Final Order. 

• 

•  Train personnel on the new procedure and provide the training records to 
the Director Central Region upon completion of the revision of the 
procedure. 
Implement the new procedure and provide quarterly reports to the 
Director, Central Region, PHMSA. The revised evaluation of the system 
must be completed within 360 days of the receipt of the Final Order. Any 
requests for an extension must be made a minimum of 30 days in advance. 

B. 

C. 

In regard to Item 2 of the Notice pertaining to missed Moderate Consequence 
Areas (MCAs), NNG must review all processes that are associated with the 
identification of MCAs to determine how existing structure and roadway MCAs 
were not previously identified and provide documentation of the review to the 
Director, Central Region within 90 days of issuance of the Final Order. Once this 
review is complete, NNG must ensure all MCAs and other pipe segments subject 
to § 192.710 are identified and submit the final results to the Director, Central 
Region within 180 days of issuance of the Final Order. 

It is requested that Northern Natural Gas Company maintain documentation of the 
safety improvement costs associated with fulfilling this Compliance Order and 
submit the total to Gregory A Ochs, Director, Central Region, Pipeline and 
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. It is requested that these costs be 
reported in two categories: (1) total cost associated with preparation/revision of 
plans, procedures, studies and analyses, and (2) total cost associated with 
replacements, additions and other changes to pipeline infrastructure.
