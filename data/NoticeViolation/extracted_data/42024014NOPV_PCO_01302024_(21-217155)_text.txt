Dear Mr. Capsimalis: 

CPF 4-2024-014-NOPV 

From July 11, 2021, to November 27, 2023, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous 
Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), pursuant to Chapter 
601 of 49 United States Code (U.S.C.), reviewed and inspected an Integrity Assurance 
notification submitted on June 30, 2021, by Rosefield Operating Company, LLC (Rosefield), 
regarding its High Island Pipeline System that transports crude oil from offshore locations to 
Texas City, Texas. 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that Rosefield has committed probable violation(s) of 
the Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.).  The item(s) 
investigated and the probable violation(s) are: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
1. 

§195.452 Pipeline integrity management in high consequence areas. 

(a)  …. 
(j)  What is a continual process of evaluation and assessment to maintain a 

pipeline's integrity? 

(1)  General. After completing the baseline integrity assessment, an operator 
must continue to assess the line pipe at specified intervals and periodically evaluate 
the integrity of each pipeline segment that could affect a high consequence area. 

(2)  …. 
(3)  Assessment intervals. An operator must establish five-year intervals, not to 

exceed 68 months, for continually assessing the line pipe's integrity. An operator 
must base the assessment intervals on the risk the line pipe poses to the high 
consequence area to determine the priority for assessing the pipeline segments. An 
operator must establish the assessment intervals based on the factors specified in 
paragraph (e) of this section, the analysis of the results from the last integrity 
assessment, and the information analysis required by paragraph (g) of this section. 

Rosefield failed to continually assess the line pipe’s integrity within a five-year interval, not to 
exceed 68 months, in accordance with 49 C.F.R. § 195.452(j)(3).  Specifically, the last integrity 
assessment performed on the High Island Pipeline System was June 8, 2015.  Therefore, 
Rosefield failed to assess its High Island Pipeline System within the interval required by 
§195.452(j)(3). 

Proposed Civil Penalty 
Under 49 U.S.C. § 60122 and 49 CFR § 190.223, you are subject to a civil penalty not to exceed 
$257,664 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,576,627 for a 
related series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after March 21, 2022 and before 
January 6, 2023, the maximum penalty may not exceed $239,142 per violation per day the 
violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,391,412 for a related series of violations.  For violation 
occurring on or after May 3, 2021 and before March 21, 2022, the maximum penalty may not 
exceed $225,134 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,251,334 for 
a related series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after January 11, 2021 and before 
May 3, 2021, the maximum penalty may not exceed $222,504 per violation per day the violation 
persists, up to a maximum of $2,225,034 for a related series of violations.  For violation 
occurring on or after July 31, 2019 and before January 11, 2021, the maximum penalty may not 
exceed $218,647 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,186,465 for 
a related series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after November 27, 2018 and before 
July 31, 2019, the maximum penalty may not exceed $213,268 per violation per day, with a 
maximum penalty not to exceed $2,132,679.  For violation occurring on or after November 2, 
2015 and before November 27, 2018, the maximum penalty may not exceed $209,002 per 
violation per day, with a maximum penalty not to exceed $2,090,022. 

We have reviewed the circumstances and supporting documents involved in this case, and have 
decided not to propose a civil penalty assessment at this time.

B. 

In regard to Item Number 1 of the Notice pertaining to Rosefield’s failure to 
conduct a continual integrity assessment in accordance with 49 C.F.R. § 
195.452(j)(3), Rosefield must perform an integrity assessment on its High Island 
Pipeline System within 90 days of receipt of the Final Order. Rosefield must 
submit records documenting the completion of the assessment to PHMSA within 
60 days of receipt of the reassessment final report. 

It is requested (not mandated) that Rosefield maintain documentation of the safety 
improvement costs associated with fulfilling this Compliance Order and submit 
the total to Bryan Lethcoe, Director, Southwest Region, Office of Pipeline Safety,
