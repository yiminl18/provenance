PROPOSED COMPLIANCE ORDER 

VIA ELECTRONIC MAIL TO: Massimo.insulla@eni.com 

December 27, 2023 

Mr. Massimo Insulla 
President, CEO 
Eni US Operating Co., Inc. 
1200 Smith St., Suite 1700  
Houston, TX 77002 

Dear Mr. Insulla: 

CPF 5-2023-019-NOPV 

From April 25 through April 29, 2022, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 
Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 
United States Code (U.S.C.), inspected your Nikaitchuq assets in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska.   

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that you have committed probable violation of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The items inspected, 
and the probable violations are: 

1. 

§ 195.310  Records. 

(a)  . . . . 
(b)  The record required by paragraph (a) of this section must include: 
(1)  . . . . 
(2)  Test instrument calibration data; 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
(4)  The date and time of the test; 
(7)  A description of the facility tested and the test apparatus; 

ENI US Operating Co., Inc. (ENI) failed to maintain proper documentation of a hydrotest 
performed in 2021.  Exhibit H-1 to this NOPV is a record of the hydrotest titled D2P03 SID 
Subsea Diesel Line DOT Hydro 2021 completed by Udelhoven Oilfield System Services Inc. 
(UOSS).  The Pipe Test Record (on page 27 of Exhibit H-1), showed that a gauge titled Crystal 
Gauge UDE7539 had a calibration due date of March 18, 2021, however, the gauge was utilized 
during testing to record temperature on July 8, 2021.  The record reviewed did not include test 
instrument calibration data for Crystal Gauge UDE7539 to show that it was calibrated prior to its 
use on July 8, 2021.  Further, on page 35 of Exhibit H-1, the Certificate of Calibration, identified 
Asset No. UDE7539s having a Serial No. of 567539, however page 27 of Exhibit H-1 identified 
the same gauge as having a serial number of UDE7539/000273. The serial numbers did not 
match between records, and it cannot be verified whether the gauge used in the hydrotest was 
calibrated. 

In addition, page 8 of Exhibit H-1 indicated that blinds for Lockout Tag No. 34837 through No. 
34844 were installed on July 9, 2021, and removed on July 8, 2021, however the test was 
completed July 8, 2021.  The blinds were installed to isolate the portion of the pipeline that was 
being hydrotested.  The order of events documented by the records did not outline a sensible 
order of these events.  The operator either didn't describe their blind installation and lock-out/tag-
out system correctly or the incorrect dates of blind installation were recorded. The operator 
wouldn't have been able to test the pipeline without the blinds installed to isolate that section of 
the pipeline. 

Finally, page 27 of Exhibit H-1showed the foreman of the hydrotest and the UOSS Inspector 
signed for the Spy Island Drilling (SID) segment of the test on July 9, 2021, but the test was 
conducted and completed on July 8, 2021. 

2. 

§ 195.402  Procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies. 

(a)  General.  Each operator shall prepare and follow for each pipeline system a 
manual of written procedures for conducting normal operations and maintenance 
activities and handling abnormal operations and emergencies. This manual shall be 
reviewed at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each calendar year, 
and appropriate changes made as necessary to insure that the manual is effective. 
This manual shall be prepared before initial operations of a pipeline system 
commence, and appropriate parts shall be kept at locations where operations and 
maintenance activities are conducted. 

The required review of the O&M manual was inadequately documented.  Some procedures 
documented revision numbers and dates; however several instances were discovered where 
signature blocks indicating acceptance of revised procedures were not completed by the required 
personnel. 

For example, shown in Exhibit B-4, a review of a procedure titled DOT Work Ticket, was 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
completed on January 7, 2022. Exhibit B-4, Page 7/38, Certification of Procedure, demonstrated 
revision 01 was issued for use, however the signatures and dates for approval from the 
Maintenance Supervisor (David Coombes and Rick Kennedy), Production Superintendent 
(Stephen Dexheimer and Dan Lyden), and Maintenance Manager (Francesco Pitzailis) were 
absent. Exhibit B-4, Page 3/36, KPP01 Shutdown Valve, SDV-12021 Semi-Annual DOT PM 
Procedure was not signed, dated, and approved prior to use in the field. The procedure’s 
inadequacy and lack of review was evidenced on Pages 21 through 25 out of 36 of Exhibit B-4. 
These procedural steps had both inserted text and handwritten notes entered into the “Action” 
columns, while other text was crossed out, indicating the procedure was a draft and not a 
finalized procedure. ENI did not provide an adequate procedure for field personnel to follow as 
evidenced in Exhibit B-4. 

3. 

§ 195.420  Valve maintenance. 

(a)  Each operator shall maintain each valve that is necessary for the safe operation 
of its pipeline systems in good working order at all times. 

ENI failed to maintain each valve that is necessary for the safe operation of its pipeline in good 
working order at all times.  Specifically, the 2020 and 2021 valve inspection and maintenance 
records for the 10-inch Sales Oil pipeline failed to evidence that ENI performed proper valve 
maintenance on its pipeline on five separate occasions. 

First, ENI’s valve maintenance record of Shut Down Valve KPP01-SDV-12021, dated January 
8, 2021 (Exhibit B-1) included a sheet labeled “Annex B”, with a table labeled “Function Test 
and Greasing”, and a column header labeled “[Check] Performed”. The column was left blank 
indicating that no valve maintenance work was performed, despite ENI checking a box on the 
form stating that valve maintenance requirements were met. Without complete documentation of 
the work performed, valve maintenance could not be verified. 

Second, ENI’s valve maintenance record for Shut Down Valve KPP01-SDV-12021, dated July 
5, 2021 (Exhibit B-2), similarly failed to evidence proper valve maintenance.  This record 
included a sheet labeled “Valve and actuator Info”, with a table labeled “Function Test and 
Greasing”, and a column header labeled “[Check] Below if Performed”.  The column was left 
blank.  This maintenance record did not indicate if the valve was greased or if the valve had 
adequate grease.  Without this completed documentation, valve maintenance could not be 
verified. 

Third, the valve maintenance record for Shut Down Valve, KPP01-SDV-12021, dated January 
21, 2020 (Exhibit B-3) included a sheet labeled “Valve and actuator Info”, with a table labeled 
“Function Test and Greasing”, and a column header labeled “[Check] Below if Performed”. The 
column was left blank. This maintenance record did not indicate the valve was greased. Without 
this completed documentation, valve maintenance could not be verified. 

Fourth, the valve maintenance record for ENI’s 2-inch Diesel pipeline, Shut Down Valve, 
D2P03-SDV-53601 (Exhibit C-1), dated January 10, 2021, included a sheet labeled "Valve and 
actuator info", with a table "Function Test and Greasing". The row labeled "Grease Valve" was 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
left blank. This maintenance record showed no indication the valve was greased nor that it was in 
an acceptable condition. Without this completed documentation, valve maintenance could not be 
verified. 

Fifth, the valve maintenance record for Shut Down Valve, D2P03-SDV-53601, dated January 8, 
2020 (Exhibit C-2) included a sheet labeled "Valve and actuator info", with a table "Function 
Test and Greasing". The row labeled "Grease Valve" stated [the valve] was "Not greased". This 
maintenance record showed no indication the valve was greased nor that it was in an acceptable 
condition. Without this completed documentation, valve maintenance could not be verified.

§ 195.452  Pipeline integrity management in high consequence areas. 

(a)  . . . . 
(f)  What are the elements of an integrity management program?  An integrity 
management program begins with the initial framework.  An operator must 
continually change the program to reflect operating experience, conclusions drawn 
from results of the integrity assessments, and other maintenance and surveillance 
data, and evaluation of consequences of a failure on the high consequence area.  An 
operator must include, at minimum, each of the following elements in its written 
integrity management program: 
(1)  . . . . 
(3)  An analysis that integrates all available information about the integrity of the 
entire pipeline and the consequences of a failure … 

ENI’s Sales Oil Pipeline and Nikaitchuq Diesel Pipeline are both located within high 
consequence areas (HCAs). ENI’s integrity management program failed to include an analysis 
that integrated all available information about the integrity of its Sales Oil Pipeline and its 
Nikaitchuq Diesel Pipeline and the consequences of a failure. 

Specifically, the 2021 risk analysis (Exhibit A-11) for the 10-inch Sale Oil Pipeline included 
outdated information in 15 areas, as follows: 

•  Per IMP Revision 1.2 (2021 version), Exhibit A-11, on Page 72/158, Pipe Segment: Sales 
Oil Pipeline Segment 1 Internal Corrosion, row 3, Pipeline Age, stated record/score was 
based on "6 to 10 years" age of pipeline. The Sales Oil Pipeline was installed in 2010. 

•  Per IMP Revision 1.2 (2021 version), Exhibit A-11, on Page 73/158, Pipe Segment: Sales 
Oil Pipeline Segment 1, Stress-Corrosion Cracking, row 7, Years Since Last Pressure

installed in 2010. 

The risk analysis for ENI’s 2-inch Nikaitchuq Diesel Pipeline Risk similarly contained outdated 
information and therefore did not include an analysis that integrated all available information 
about the integrity of the pipeline and the consequences of a failure.  Specifically, the records 
reviewed indicated outdated information was used in the risk analysis in six areas, as follows: 

•  Per IMP Revision 1.2 (2021 version), Exhibit A-11, on Page 108/158, Pipe Segment: 2” 
Nikaitchuq Diesel Pipeline, Internal-Corrosion, row 3, Pipeline Age, stated record/score 
was based on a "6 to 10 years" age of pipeline. The Nikaitchuq Diesel Pipeline was 
installed in 2009. The same page, row 4, Frequency of In-Line Inspection or Pressure 
Test for Internal Corrosion Detection, stated “greater than 2 years less than 3 years” 
based on the last pressure test conducted in “July 2016.” The last pressure test conducted, 
per Exhibit H-1, was conducted in 2021.

§ 195.452  Pipeline integrity management in high consequence areas. 

(a)  . . . . 
(h)  What actions must an operator take to address integrity issues?  -
(1)  General requirements.  An operator must take prompt action to address all 
anomalous conditions in the pipeline that the operator discovers through the 
integrity assessment or information analysis. In addressing all conditions, an 
operator must evaluate all anomalous conditions and remediate those that could 
reduce a pipeline's integrity, as required by this part. An operator must be able to 
demonstrate that the remediation of the condition will ensure that the condition is 
unlikely to pose a threat to the long-term integrity of the pipeline. An operator must 
comply with all other applicable requirements in this part in remediating a 
condition. Each operator must, in repairing its pipeline systems, ensure that the 
repairs are made in a safe and timely manner and are made so as to prevent damage 
to persons, property, or the environment. The calculation method(s) used for 
anomaly evaluation must be applicable for the range of relevant threats. 

ENI failed to take prompt action to address a known anomalous condition on its 10-inch Sales 
Oil Pipeline.  Specifically, in June 2020, ENI retained Coffman Engineers to perform an 
Atmospheric Corrosion Inspection on its Nikaitchuq assets, which included the 10-inch Sales Oil 
pipeline. The Atmospheric Corrosion Inspection Report (Exhibit K-1) described the as found 
condition of the KPP Pig Receiver segment as follows: “[p]ipe noted to be submerged in water at 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
road crossing nearby the KPP Pig Receiver facility. The pipe should be removed from contact 
with the water, if practical.” The Atmospheric Corrosion Inspection report included two photos 
showing that the Sales Oil pipeline was “approximately 50 percent submerged.”  The 
Atmospheric Corrosion Inspection Report included a recommendation that, “[i]f practical, 
remove the contact between the water and the sales oil pipeline near the KPP pig receiver 
module pad and include this section of pipe in NDT inspection programs, if implemented.” 
Despite this recommendation to address a known anomalous condition, ENI could not produce 
any documentation to show that cathodic protection was installed on the 10-inch Sales Oil 
pipeline, that they inspected the submerged segment, or that they performed an evaluation of the 
inundated pipeline insulation. ENI could not provide evidence of evaluation or remedial action 
taken due to the anomalous condition discovered and documented via the official Coffman 
Atmospheric Corrosion Inspection Report of July 3, 2020. 

6. 

§ 195.452  Pipeline integrity management in high consequence areas. 

(a)  . . . . 
(l) What records must an operator keep to demonstrate compliance? 
(1) An operator must maintain, for the useful life of the pipeline, records that 
demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this subpart. At a minimum, an 
operator must maintain the following records for review during an inspection: 
(i)  . . . . 
(ii)  Documents to support the decisions and analyses, including any modifications, 
justifications, deviations and determinations made, variances, and actions taken, to 
implement and evaluate each element of the integrity management program listed in 
paragraph (f) of this section. 

ENI failed to document certain decisions and analysis it made with respect to recommended 
preventative and mitigative measures when implementing its integrity management program. 
Specifically, ENI’s 2018 Pipeline Integrity Evaluation for the 10-inch Sales Oil Pipeline 
evaluated preventive and mitigative measures (Exhibit I-1).  This record included a proposal to 
"[i]nstall remotely controlled valves" to mitigate the amount of a possible release, and two 
preventative measures to "[e]stablish shorter inspection intervals" and to "[c]onduct radiography 
for under insulation corrosion" to prevent a possible release.  Part 5 of the Pipeline Integrity 
Evaluation “Approval of Recommended Measures” was a form that listed the preventive and 
mitigative measures that were considered, evaluated, and had boxes where the reviewer was to 
indicate whether the measures were approved or disapproved.  The indication boxes in Part 5 
were blank, without comments, and no decision was documented as to whether to accept or 
reject the proposed measures.  The form was then approved and signed without determination of 
recommended measures.

§ 195.503  Definitions 

Qualified means that an individual has been evaluated and can: 

(a) Perform assigned covered tasks and 
(b) Recognize and react to abnormal operating conditions. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
  
 
  
 
ENI failed to ensure through evaluation that individuals performing covered tasks were qualified. 
Specifically, a valve maintenance record for Shut Down Valve, D2P03-SDV-53601, on ENI’s 2-
inch Diesel Pipeline (Exhibit C-1) included reference to an individual who performed the valve 
maintenance but was not qualified to recognize or respond to an abnormal operating condition 
(AOC). Valve maintenance for the 2-inch Diesel pipeline, Shut Down Valve, D2P03-SDV-
53601 was considered a covered task where individuals performing the task must also be 
qualified to respond to any AOCs. Records did not demonstrate the individual was able to 
recognize or respond to an AOC while performing valve maintenance, therefore the individual 
was not qualified to conduct covered tasks. During the inspection, ENI produced a DOT work 
ticket, which stated that the “Covered Task 100.01-Abnormal conditions outside control room” 
(Exhibit C-1) required the performance of valve maintenance by a qualified individual.  The 
work ticket identified the name of the individual who performed the covered task, however, the 
qualification records for this individual did not include a qualification for covered task 100.01-
Abnormal conditions outside control room. 

The Employee / Tasks Qualified table for the employee who performed the valve maintenance 
did not list a qualification for Covered Task 100.01-Abnormal conditions outside control room at 
the time the record was generated on January 11, 2021. The operator could not produce records 
demonstrating that the employee was qualified to respond to AOCs while conducting valve 
maintenance on January 10, 2021.

§ 195.505  Qualification program. 

Each operator shall have and follow a written qualification program. The program 
shall include provisions to: 
(a)  . . . . 
(h)  After December 16, 2004, provide training, as appropriate, to ensure that 
individuals performing covered tasks have the necessary knowledge and skills to 
perform the tasks in a manner that ensures the safe operation of pipeline facilities; 

ENI used Midwest Energy Association’s (MEA) Remote Evaluations procedure, Initial 
Qualification Methods and Records (Exhibit E-3), to complete operator qualification evaluations 
remotely during the coronavirus pandemic. MEA procedure for conducting remote evaluations 
included recommended steps that required the proctor take extensive notes indicating 
communication devices used, verification of audio and video quality, and verification that the 
employee to be qualified cannot be assisted, among other requirements. ENI qualified personnel 
without adequate documentation to demonstrate adherence to the MEA procedure. 

Qualification records reviewed for a qualified individual did not indicate the type of 
communication device utilized, did not verify the quality of the audio or video, nor indicated 
verification that the individual being tested could not be assisted during evaluation as required by 
the MEA Procedure. Recordings of the evaluations conducted on June 18, 2021 were not 
available for PHMSA review.

§ 195.555  What are the qualifications for supervisors? 

You must require and verify that supervisors maintain a thorough knowledge of 
that portion of the corrosion control procedures established under § 195.402(c)(3) 
for which they are responsible for insuring compliance. 

ENI failed to require and verify that supervisors maintained a thorough knowledge of the 
corrosion control procedures for which they were responsible for insuring compliance. 
Specifically, ENI’s, DOT Pipeline O&M Manual, Section 3.1 Supervisor Training and 
Qualifications (Exhibit A-1) described the requirement for Facility Engineers and Maintenance 
Supervisors. The final paragraph of section 3.1 stated “[t]he Production Manager will sign-off 
that the Facility Engineer and Maintenance Supervisor has received and understands this 
information.” 

ENI’s Supervisor Qualification Check Sheet, Appendix D (Exhibit E-2), was identified as the 
form used by the operator to verify supervisors were knowledgeable in corrosion control 
procedures. The form had no signature or a date for the evaluation of two supervisors. 

Proposed Civil Penalty
