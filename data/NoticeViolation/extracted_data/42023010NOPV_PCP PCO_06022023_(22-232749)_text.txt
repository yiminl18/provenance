Mr. Steve Ledbetter 
VP Shell Midstream Partners GP LLC 
Shell Pipeline Company, LP 
150 North Dairy Ashford, Building A, Fourth Floor 
Houston, TX 77079 

Dear Mr. Ledbetter: 

CPF 4-2023-010-NOPV 

From May 9 through November 22, 2022, a representative of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 
Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 
United  States  Code  (U.S.C.)  inspected  Shell  Pipeline  Company,  LP’s  (Shell)  hazardous  liquid 
pipeline systems in Texas, Louisiana, and the Gulf of Mexico. 

As  a  result  of  the  inspection,  it  is  alleged  that  you  have  committed  probable  violations  of  the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The items inspected 
and the probable violations are: 

1. 

§ 195.420 Valve maintenance. 

(a)  . . . . 
(b) Each operator shall, at intervals not exceeding 7 1/2 months, but 
at  least  twice  each  calendar  year,  inspect  each  mainline  valve  to 
determine that it is functioning properly. 

Shell failed to inspect each mainline valve to determine that it is functioning properly at intervals 
not exceeding 7 ½ months but at least twice each calendar year in accordance with § 195.420(b). 
Specifically,  Shell  failed  to  inspect  the  following  35  mainline  valves  twice  each  calendar  year 
and/or within 7 ½ months from 2020 to 2022 for 56 instances: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.  Crude  System  Valve  Equipment  No:  2044008,  2042012,  2064000,  2064002, 
2064009,  2144098,  2131321,  1000356,  1032009,  2336005,  1020307,  1020305, 
1020326,  1002011,  1002013,  1009628,  1012904,  1014255,  1014256,  1024300, 
1024301,  2130495,  2404338,  2404340,  2404992,  2404993,  2404994,  2405001, 
2405003, 2406171, 2410000, 2410002, 2410004, 2410015, and 2410020. 

2.  Highly  Volatile  Liquids  (HVL)  System  Valve  Equipment  No:  3217501,  and 
3217508. 

Therefore,  Shell  failed  to  conduct  inspections  for  each  mainline  valve  to  determine  that  it  is 
functioning properly at intervals not exceeding 7 ½ months but at least twice each calendar year 
in accordance with § 195.420(b). 

2. 

§ 195.428 Overpressure safety devices and overfill protection systems. 
(a)  Except  as  provided  in  paragraph  (b)  of  this  section,  each 
operator shall, at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once 
each  calendar  year,  or  in  the  case  of  pipelines  used  to  carry  highly 
volatile liquids, at intervals not to exceed 7 1⁄2 months, but at least twice 
each calendar year, inspect and test each pressure limiting device, relief 
valve, pressure regulator, or other item of pressure control equipment 
to  determine  that  it  is  functioning  properly,  is  in  good  mechanical 
condition,  and  is  adequate  from  the  standpoint  of  capacity  and 
reliability of operation for the service in which it is used. 

Shell failed to inspect and test each pressure limiting device, relief valve, pressure regulator or 
other item of pressure control equipment to determine that it is functioning properly at intervals 
not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each calendar year, or in the case of pipelines used to 
carry highly volatile liquids, at intervals not to exceed 7 ½ months, but at least twice each calendar 
year in accordance with § 195.428(a). 

Shell failed to inspect the following 7 overpressure safety devices once each calendar year and/or 
within 15 months from 2020 to 2022 for 11 instances: 

1.  Crude  System  Valve  Equipment  No:  1019997,  1019998,  2131376,  1029264, 

1029259, 1012490, and 1012491. 

Shell failed to inspect the following 7 overpressure safety devices twice each calendar year and/or 
within 7 ½ months from 2020 to 2022 for 14 instances: 

2.  HVL  System  Valve  Equipment  No:  2194024,  1025341,  2194027,  2194025, 

1025340, 3207629, 1009765. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Therefore,  Shell  failed  to  inspect  and  test  each  pressure  limiting  device,  relief  valve,  pressure 
regulator or other item of pressure control equipment to determine that it is functioning properly 
at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each calendar year, or in the case of pipelines 
used to carry highly volatile liquids, at intervals not to exceed 7 ½ months, but at least twice each 
calendar year in accordance with § 195.428(a). 

3. 

§ 195.505 Qualification program. 

Each  operator  shall  have  and  follow  a  written  qualification 

program. The program shall include provisions to: 

(a)  . . . . 
(b) Ensure through evaluation that individuals performing covered 

tasks are qualified; 

Shell failed to follow its written qualification program to ensure through evaluation that individuals 
performing covered tasks are qualified in accordance with § 195.505(b).  Specifically, Shell failed 
to  ensure  that  only  qualified  employees  perform  covered  tasks  without  supervision.  An 
unqualified  employee  (Employee  ID:  152539)  performed  37  valve  inspections,  a  covered  task 
(020.00) from December 2020 to July 27, 2022 without supervision of a qualified inspector.  After 
the inspection, Shell stated it qualified this employee. 

Therefore, Shell failed to follow its written qualification program to ensure through evaluation that 
individuals performing covered tasks are qualified in accordance with § 195.505(b). 

4. 

§ 195.573 What must I do to monitor external corrosion control? 

(a)  . . . . 
(e)  Corrective action.  You must correct any identified deficiency 
in  corrosion  control  as  required  by  §  195.401(b).  However,  if  the 
deficiency  involves  a  pipeline  in  an  integrity  management  program 
under  §  195.452,  you  must  correct  the  deficiency  as  required  by  § 
195.452(h). 

Shell failed to correct each identified deficiency in corrosion control in accordance § 195.573(e). 
Specifically, Shell failed to correct the identified annual cathodic protection survey deficiencies 
on Ship Shoal 22 Loop at MP 7.5 within a reasonable time.  The pipe to soil value on Ship Shoal 
22 Loop at MP 7.5 was -0.717 on March 18, 2021, and -0.706 on March 16, 2022.  Shell corrected 
this deficiency after PHMSA’s inspection. 

Therefore, Shell failed to correct each identified deficiency in corrosion control in accordance § 
195.573(e). 

Proposed Civil Penalty 

Under 49 U.S.C. § 60122 and 49 CFR § 190.223, you are subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
