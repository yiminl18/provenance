Dear Ms. Hansen: 

From March 28 through September 23, 2022, representatives of the Pipeline and Hazardous 
Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), pursuant to Chapter 
601 of 49 United States Code (U.S.C.), inspected the Enbridge_Gas_Spectra_TX_Eastern_East 
inspection system which consists of two of your subsidiaries, namely, Texas Eastern 
Transmission, LP (TET East) and Egan Hub Storage, LLC, across Alabama, Kentucky, 
Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Texas. 

As a result of the inspection, it is alleged that you have committed probable violations of the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The items inspected 
and the probable violations are: 

1. 

§ 192.625 Odorization of gas. 

(a)  A  combustible  gas  in  a  distribution  line  must  contain  a  natural  odorant  or  be 
odorized so that at a concentration in air of one-fifth of the lower explosive limit, 
the gas is readily detectable by a person with a normal sense of smell. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(b)  After December 31, 1976, a combustible gas in a transmission line in a Class 3 or 
Class  4  location  must  comply  with  the  requirements  of  paragraph  (a)  of  this 
section unless: 

(1)  . . . . 
(3)  In the case of a lateral line which transports gas to a distribution center, at least 

50 percent of the length of that line is in a Class 1 or Class 2 location; 

Texas Eastern Transmission did not odorize a lateral that is located in a Class 3 area. 
This location of the lateral did not meet the exception from odorization for being in an 
area where it is at least fifty percent (50%) Class 1or 2. 

At the intersection of Highway 65 and Highway 412 near Columbia, Tennessee, a lateral 
(Line ID 15-F) branches off Line 15 to a meter station.  The length of that lateral is 
approximately 0.20 miles.  The lateral is located entirely in a Class 3 area, according to 
Texas Eastern personnel, and does not meet the exception in § 192.625(b)(3).  Therefore, 
the lateral must be odorized. 

Proposed Civil Penalty 
Under 49 U.S.C. § 60122 and 49 CFR § 190.223, you are subject to a civil penalty not to exceed 
$257,664 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,576,627 for a 
related series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after March 21, 2022 and before 
January 6, 2023, the maximum penalty may not exceed $239,142 per violation per day the 
violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,391,412 for a related series of violations.  For violation 
occurring on or after May 3, 2021 and before March 21, 2022, the maximum penalty may not 
exceed $225,134 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,251,334 for 
a related series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after January 11, 2021 and before 
May 3, 2021, the maximum penalty may not exceed $222,504 per violation per day the violation 
persists, up to a maximum of $2,225,034 for a related series of violations.  For violation 
occurring on or after July 31, 2019 and before January 11, 2021, the maximum penalty may not 
exceed $218,647 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,186,465 for 
a related series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after November 27, 2018 and before 
July 31, 2019, the maximum penalty may not exceed $213,268 per violation per day, with a 
maximum penalty not to exceed $2,132,679.  For violation occurring on or after November 2, 
2015 and before November 27, 2018, the maximum penalty may not exceed $209,002 per 
violation per day, with a maximum penalty not to exceed $2,090,022. 

We have reviewed the circumstances and supporting documents involved in this case, and have 
decided not to propose a civil penalty assessment at this time.

Safety Administration proposes to issue a Compliance Order to Texas Eastern Transmission.

PROPOSED COMPLIANCE ORDER 

Pursuant to 49 United States Code § 60118, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety 
Administration (PHMSA) proposes to issue to Texas Eastern Transmission a Compliance Order 
incorporating the following remedial requirements to ensure the compliance of Texas Eastern
Transmission with the pipeline safety regulations: 

A. 

In regard to item 1 of the Notice pertaining to odorizing Line ID 15-F, Texas 
Eastern Transmission must submit a schedule for odorizing Line ID 15-F within 
30 days of receipt of the Final Order.  Within 60 days of receipt of the Final 
Order, identify all laterals within the Texas Eastern Transmission East (TET East) 
inspection system that meet the requirement of odorization in accordance with 
§192.625(b)(3) and submit a proposed schedule to add odorization to the 
identified laterals.  Finally, odorization of line 15-F must be completed within 270 
days of receipt of the Final Order.  Once odorization is complete for the additional 
identified laterals that require odorization (if any are identified) in accordance 
with §192.625(b)(3), submit evidence of the completed work. 

B.  When Proposed Compliance Order items extend beyond 90 days to complete, 

Texas Eastern Transmission must begin, and continue submitting quarterly reports 
until all work necessary to implement the Compliance Order items is complete 
and the Final Order closed.  Quarterly reports shall be submitted to Gregory A. 
Ochs, Director, OPS Central Region, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety 
Administration. 

C. 

It is requested that Texas Eastern Transmission maintain documentation of the 
safety improvement costs associated with fulfilling this Compliance Order and 
submit the total to Gregory A. Ochs, Director, OPS Central Region, Pipeline and 
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.  It is requested that these costs be 
reported in two categories: 1) total cost associated with preparation/revision of 
plans, procedures, studies and analyses, and 2) total cost associated with 
replacements, additions and other changes to pipeline infrastructure.
