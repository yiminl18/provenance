Mr. Martyn Willsher 
President and Chief Executive Officer 
Amplify Energy Corp. 
111 Ocean Boulevard, Suite 1240 
Long Beach, CA 90802 

Dear Mr. Willsher: 

CPF 5-2023-011-NOPV 

On October 1, 2021, the San Pedro Bay Pipeline, operated by Beta Offshore, a subsidiary of 
Amplify Energy Corp., failed off the coast of California, spilling approximately 588 barrels of 
crude oil into the San Pedro Bay, an inlet of the Pacific Ocean (Failure). On October 3 through 
22, 2021, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 60117, representatives of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 
Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), responded to the failure site 
to conduct an accident investigation.  Various other federal and state agencies also responded to 
the scene, including the United States Coast Guard (USCG), the Bureau of Safety and 
Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the 
California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), and local law enforcement.  Private oil 
spill response organizations (OSROs) under contract with Beta Offshore also responded to the 
spill to assist in clean-up efforts. 

The San Pedro Bay Pipeline is a 16-inch diameter transmission pipeline.  It is approximately 
17.79 miles in length, beginning offshore at Platform Elly, located off the coast of California in 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Federal waters, and traveling onshore to the Beta Pump Station in the City of Long Beach, 
California.  The offshore portion of the pipeline is approximately 15.19 miles in length and, the 
onshore portion is approximately 2.6 miles in length.1 

The San Pedro Bay Pipeline is monitored and controlled by Beta Offshore’s control room located 
offshore at Platform Elly, attended by one controller per 12-hour shift and staffed 24 hours per 
day2.  The control rooms utilize a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) System 
to remotely monitor and control the San Pedro Bay Pipeline.  SCADA information, including 
pressure and flow information, line status, and system condition, is displayed on consoles located 
in the control room. Beta Offshore also utilizes a leak detection software known as ATMOS 
PIPE™ (ATMOS).3  ATMOS is integrated into the SCADA system and provides real-time 
information on leak status of the San Pedro Bay Pipeline.4 

On October 1, 2021, at approximately 4:10 pm,5 the controller received ATMOS alarms 
indicating a leak was detected on the San Pedro Bay Pipeline.6  Believing the alarm was caused 
by a loss of communication, the controller manually turned off the shipping pumps to “let it sit 
and settle out” before manually turning the pumps back on, believing this would clear the 
incoming alarms. 7  ATMOS, however, continued to generate leak alarms as the controller and 
others tried to determine if there was a leak, and if so, where it was located.8  The controller 
proceeded to turn the shipping pumps on and off several more times in an effort to clear the 
alarms, before finally shutting down the San Pedro Bay Pipeline on the following day, October 2, 
2021, at 6:04 am, approximately 14 hours after the first alarm and after receiving more than 83 
leak alarms.  Two hours later, at approximately 8:15 am, the San Pedro Bay Pipeline was 

1 See Pipeline Safety Violation Report (Violation Report) at Exhibit A – Beta Offshore Annual Report for Calendar 
Year 2021. 

2 Beta Offshore has an additional control room located onshore at the Beta Pump Station.  This control room 
controls the onshore portion of the San Pedro Bay Pipeline only.  It is manned during the day shift, Monday-Friday, 
by one controller. 

3 ATMOS applies statistical techniques to the instrument readings, such as flow and pressure measurements taken at 
the inlet, outlet, and block valves along the pipeline, to determine whether these measurements correspond to normal 
pipeline operation, or a leak condition. See Violation Report at Exhibit B - Atmos LD 2001 Operation and 
Maintenance Manual V1.0, pg. 4. 

4 ATMOS sends a leak detection output signal to the SCADA system every ten (10) seconds.  See Violation Report 
at Exhibit B - Atmos LD 2001 Operation and Maintenance Manual V1.0, pg. 6. 

5 All times are in Pacific Time unless otherwise noted. 

6 See Violation Report at Exhibit C - Alarm History (indicating that the alarm description was “Signal from ATMOS 
– Leak Detected”).  ATMOS was only installed on the San Pedro Bay Pipeline and did not alarm on other 
infrastructure, such as the platforms. 

7 See Violation Report at Exhibit D - NTSB Interview Transcripts of Beta Offshore Personnel. Beta Offshore does 
not have a written procedure for this process. 

8 In an NTSB interview, the controller explained that he believed the first alarm “was just a regular loss of 
communication.” See Violation Report at Exhibit D - NTSB Interview Transcripts of Beta Offshore Personnel.

The National Response Center (NRC) received several notifications related to the Failure: 

•  On October 1, 2021, at 7:59 pm, the NRC received a call from a third party reporting an 

unknown sheen in the water near its vessel in the Pacific Ocean.10 

•  On October 2, 2021, at 1:57 am, the NRC received a call from the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reporting an unconfirmed oil leak near the beach 
in Huntington Beach, California, measuring approximately 2.8 nautical miles (nm) in 
length and up to 0.7 nm in width.11 

•  On October 2, 2021, at 9:07 am, the NRC received a call from Witt O’Brien’s LLC12 
reporting a discharge of an unknown amount of crude oil into the Pacific Ocean.  The 
report noted that the discharge was observed in the vicinity of a pipeline after a drop in 
pressure was noticed due to unknown causes.13 

•  On October 3, 2021, at 1:41 pm, the NRC received a call from the USCG reporting a 

potential major crude oil pollution incident associated with platforms Elly and Ellen in 
Newport Beach.14  The report also stated that there were oiled wildlife and dead fish. 

•  On October 3, 2021, at 2:20 pm, the NRC received another call from USCG estimating 

that the spill amount was approximately 3,440 barrels.15 

•  On October 4, 2021, at 8:42 pm, the NRC received another call from Witt O’Brien’s LLC 
reporting that Beta Offshore joined the USCG and OSRO organizations responding to the 
oil spill by containing and recovering the spilled oil.  The report noted that Laguna Beach 
shorelines and Newport Beach had been impacted on water and shore sides, and 
protection strategies were implemented along the coast to protect these environmentally-

9 In an NTSB interview, the controller explained he was informed about the oil sheen on the water of San Pedro Bay 
around 8:00 am or 8:15 am. See Violation Report at Exhibit D - NTSB Interview Transcripts of Beta Offshore 
Personnel.

On October 4, 2021, PHMSA issued a Corrective Action Order (CAO), CPF No. 5-2021-054-
CAO, to Beta Offshore.  The CAO requires that the San Pedro Bay Pipeline remain shut down 
until a number of corrective measures are undertaken.  The CAO also requires, among other 
things, that Beta Offshore conduct testing of the failed pipe section and a root cause failure 
analysis and prepare a remedial work plan to ensure the safety of the pipeline.  PHMSA also 
retains authority under the CAO to review and approve any plan to restart the line.  To date, the 
San Pedro Bay Pipeline remains shut down.17 

The NTSB launched an official investigation into the cause of the Failure.18  On October 9, 2021, 
the NTSB, in collaboration with the USCG and PHMSA investigators, interviewed Beta 
Offshore personnel to learn about pipeline operations, maintenance, and emergency procedures, 
and actions taken by their personnel prior to, during, and after the Failure (NTSB Interviews).19 

On December 15, 2021, a Grand Jury for the U.S. District Court for the Central District of 
California handed down an indictment related to the Failure, charging Amplify Energy Corp., 
Beta Operating Company, LLC d/b/a Beta Offshore, and San Pedro Bay Pipeline Company with 
one misdemeanor count of negligent discharge of oil under the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. § 
1251 et seq.  On September 8, 2022, the Court accepted Defendants’ guilty plea and imposed a 
fine and a four-year probationary period.  (United States v. Amplify Energy Corp. et al., 8:21-cr-
00226 (C.D. Cal 2022)). 

On February 3, 2022, and May 12, 2022, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 60117 and 49 C.F.R. § 
190.203, PHMSA requested additional information from Beta Offshore to aid in its investigation 
into the Failure (Request for Specific Information Letters).  Beta Offshore provided responses to 
PHMSA on March 18, 2022, April 1, 2022, April 21, 2022, and June 10, 2022. 

As a result of the PHMSA investigation, it appears that Beta Offshore has committed probable 
violations of the Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations.  The items 
inspected and the probable violations are: 

1. 

§ 195.52  Immediate notice of certain accidents. 

(a)  Notice requirements.  At the earliest practicable moment following discovery, of 
a release of the hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide transported resulting in an event 
described in § 195.50, but no later than one hour after confirmed discovery, the 
operator of the system must give notice, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this 
section of any failure that: 

16 See Violation Report at Exhibit J - NRC Report #1318656. 

17 The CAO remains open as of the date of this Notice. 

18 The NTSB designated its inquiry as a marine investigation.  PHMSA is not an official party to the investigation.

(1)  . . . . 

(4)  Resulted in pollution of any stream, river, lake, reservoir, or other similar body 
of water that violated applicable water quality standards, caused a discoloration of 
the surface of the water or adjoining shoreline, or deposited a sludge or emulsion 
beneath the surface of the water or upon adjoining shorelines; or 

(5)  In the judgment of the operator was significant even though it did not meet the 
criteria of any other paragraph of this section. 

Beta Offshore failed to notify the NRC in accordance with § 195.52(a) 20 at the earliest 
practicable moment following discovery, but no later than one hour after confirmed discovery21 
of a failure that resulted in oil being released into the San Pedro Bay.  Pursuant to § 195.50, an 
accident report is required for each failure where there is a release of 5 gallons (19 liters) or more 
of hazardous liquid.22  In addition, § 195.52 requires an operator to give immediate notice to the 
NRC of a release described in § 195.50 that also impacts certain bodies of water or that is 
significant in the judgment of the operator.  On October 1, 2021, at approximately 4:10 pm, Beta 
Offshore received two ATMOS leak detection alarms indicating that a leak was detected.23  By 
4:15 pm, the estimated leak amount generated by ATMOS was 33.95 bbls (1,677.9 gallons of 
oil).24 

After receiving the leak detection alarms, indicating that a leak was present on its offshore 
underwater pipeline that had resulted in the release of approximately 33.95 bbls of crude oil, 
Beta Offshore had enough information to reasonably determine that a reportable release had 
occurred.  In fact, between 4:10 pm and 5:10 pm, ATMOS generated a total of thirteen (13) leak 

20 See 49 C.F.R. § 195.52(b) (requiring that “each notice required by paragraph (a) of this section must be made to 
the National Response Center.”). 

21 See 49 C.F.R. § 195.2 (defining “confirmed discovery” to mean “when it can be reasonably determined, based on 
information available to the operator at the time a reportable event has occurred, even if only based on a preliminary 
evaluation.”). 

22 § 195.50 Reporting accidents. 
An accident report is required for each failure in a pipeline system subject to this part in which there is a release of 
the hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide transported resulting in any of the following: 
(a) Explosion or fire not intentionally set by the operator. 
(b) Release of 5 gallons (19 liters) or more of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide… 

23 See Violation Report at Exhibit C – Alarm History; see also id. at Exhibit B – Atmos LD 2001 Operation Manual 
V1.0, page 8 (explaining how the ATMOS leak detection system algorithm determines if instrument readings 
indicate a leak is present, generates a leak alarm, and estimates the size and location of the leak allowing staff to 
assess leak severity and respond accordingly). 

24 See Violation Report at Exhibit K – SCADA Data; see also id. at Exhibit B – Atmos LD 2001 Operation Manual 
V1.0, pg. 40 (explaining how the ATMOS system estimates the size and location of the leak, noting estimates 
eventually converge upon a narrower range of values depending on the size of the leak and operating conditions, 
where a large leak under steady state operating conditions results in the most rapidly converging estimates). 

 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
alarms that were acknowledged by the controller.25 Despite multiple leak alarms and 
corresponding leak size estimates generated by ATMOS, Beta Offshore did not notify the NRC 
until 17 hours after the first leak alarms, when its contractor called the NRC on October 2, 2021, 
at 9:07 am after observing an oil sheen in the San Pedro Bay.26 

2. 

§ 195.401  General requirements. 

(a)  No operator may operate or maintain its pipeline systems at a level of safety 
lower than that required by this subpart and the procedures it is required to 
establish under § 195.402(a) of this subpart. 

Beta Offshore operated its pipeline at a level of safety that was lower than that required by 
Subpart F – Operations and Maintenance, and the procedures required to be established under § 
195.402(a).27  During the Failure event, Beta Offshore personnel decided to disengage the 
ATMOS leak detection system (i.e., place it in “sleep” mode) and use the operator’s Manual 
Leak Detection procedure to try to identify the leak while the pipeline continued to operate.28 
This procedure noted, however, that it was only to be used “[i]n the event of a communications 
breakdown between Platforms Elly and the Beta Pump Station….”29  However, there was no 
communications breakdown between Platform Elly and the Beta Pump Station during the Failure 
event. 

Further, not only did Beta Offshore use an inapplicable procedure during the Failure event, but 
they did not follow it correctly.  For example, the procedure requires controllers to immediately 
shut down the pipeline if a leak alarm occurs.30  Despite eighty-three (83) total leak alarms,31 
Beta Offshore did not immediately shut down the line and continued to operate the pipeline and 
engage in manual leak detection, resulting in effectively pumping oil into the pipeline, and 
subsequently the San Pedro Bay, for hours. 

25 See Violation Report at Exhibit C - Alarm History. 

26 See Violation Report at Exhibit G - NRC Report # 1318463. 

Even if Beta Offshore believed that ATMOS was generating false alarms and there was not a leak, given the amount 
and frequency of the alarming from the CPM system specifically designed to detect leaks, and the location of the 
pipeline in an environmentally sensitive area, personnel should have realized this event was significant enough to 
report under § 195.52(a)(5). 

27 See § 195.402(e)(3) (operators are required to have and follow emergency response procedures on taking 
necessary action, such as emergency shutdown or pressure reduction, to minimize the volume of hazardous liquid or 
carbon dioxide that is released from any section of a pipeline system in the event of a failure). 

28 See Violation Report at Exhibit B - Atmos LD 2001 Operation Manual V1.0, pgs. 14-16 noting that “sleep” mode 
should only be utilized if maintenance work is being carried out on the instrumentation associated with the leak 
detection system to avoid the generation of a false alarm during maintenance work.

§ 195.402  Procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies. 

(a)  General.  Each operator shall prepare and follow for each pipeline system a 
manual of written procedures for conducting normal operations and maintenance 
activities and handling abnormal operations and emergencies.  This manual shall be 
reviewed at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each calendar year, 
and appropriate changes made as necessary to insure that the manual is effective.  
This manual shall be prepared before initial operations of a pipeline system 
commence, and appropriate parts shall be kept at locations where operations and 
maintenance activities are conducted. 

Beta Offshore failed to follow a manual of written procedures for each pipeline system for 
conducting normal operations and maintenance activities and handling abnormal operations and 
emergencies.  During the Failure, Beta Offshore failed to follow: (1) Procedure 17.05 Pipeline – 
Start Up and Shut Down of 16” SPBPL; (2) SPBPL 16” SPBPL-009.11 - Emergency Shutdown, 
Isolation and Drawdown; (3) Procedure 1.01 - Reporting and Control of Accidents, (4) 
Procedure 5.02 - CPM and Leak Detection; and (5) Procedure 17.08 – Abnormal Operation, as 
detailed further below. 

(1)  Beta Offshore failed to follow its Procedure 17.05 Pipeline - Start Up and Shut down of 16” 
SPBPL by not immediately shutting down the San Pedro Bay Pipeline when it received two 
ATMOS leak alarms.  In relevant part, the procedure required Beta Offshore to “[i]mmediately 
shut down the pipeline and call the Platform Supervisor or PIC (person-in-charge) if any of the 
following occur; Leak warning on LDS [leak detection system].”32  Despite receiving two 
ATMOS leak alarms at approximately 4:10 pm on October 1, 2021, Beta Offshore did not notify 
the PIC until 7:15 pm and did not ultimately shut down the San Pedro Bay Pipeline until 
approximately 6:04 am on October 2, 2021.33 

(2)  Beta Offshore failed to follow its SPBPL 16” SPBPL-009.11 - Emergency Shutdown, 
Isolation and Drawdown procedure by not isolating the San Pedro Bay Pipeline immediately 
when a pipeline leak was indicated by ATMOS.  In relevant part, the procedure stated, “[i]n the 
event of an indicated or suspected pipeline leak, the San Pedro Bay Pipeline is to be isolated by 
closing Shutdown Valve SD 5-02B-1 at Platform Elly, ML-4 at the Queen Mary Vault and V-
520 and V-530 at the Beta Pump Station. After initial isolation, valve ML-1 and ML-3 will be

33 See Violation Report at Exhibit D - NTSB Interview Transcripts of Beta Offshore Personnel stating that Beta 
Offshore did not notify the PIC until 7:15pm and did not ultimately shut down the San Pedro Bay Pipeline until 
approximately 6:04am on October 2, 2021. See also id. at Exhibit P – Pump On-Off Summary. Between 4:10 pm 
and the time when the PIC was notified of the leak alarm at 7:15 pm, the following did occur while trying to 
investigate the cause of the leak alarms effectively restarting and shutting down the San Pedro Bay Pipeline each 
time; 

- Pump P05A was turned off once; 
- Pump P05B was turned on once and turned off once 
- Pump P05C was turned on three times and turned off twice. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
                                                 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
closed….”34  Despite receiving eighty-three (83) ATMOS leak alarms between 4:10 pm and 
midnight on October 1, 2021,35 Beta Offshore did not isolate the pipeline and close the requisite 
valves until approximately 8:15 am on October 2, 2021.36 

This procedure also required Beta Offshore to “[a]nnually simulate this process in the procedure 
and review with all personnel that could possibly be involved.”37  Despite this requirement, Beta 
Offshore could not provide any records to demonstrate that it annually simulated emergency 
shutdown, isolation, and drawdown of the San Pedro Bay Pipeline with its personnel for the past 
five years.38  This was evident during the Failure event when controllers and others failed to 
follow the processes prescribed in this procedure. 

(3) Beta Offshore failed to follow its Procedure 1.01 - Reporting and Control of Accidents, 
which states “[t]he [PL Supervisor and HS&E Supervisor] is responsible for the documentation 
and reporting of pipeline facility accidents”39 and “[a]t the earliest practicable moment following 
the discovery, and not later than 1 hour following the time of such confirmed discovery, of a 
hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide release meeting at least one of the criteria below, the DOT 
must be contacted by telephone at 800-424-8802 (National Response Center- NRC) and notified 
of any release resulting in any of the following….”40  Further, the PL Supervisor and HS&E 
Supervisor did not document or report the Failure pursuant to Beta Offshore’s written 
procedures; it was called in via a third-party contractor.41  In addition, Beta Offshore failed to 
report the Failure to the NRC within the time period specified by its procedures. 

(4)  Beta Offshore failed to follow its Procedure 5.02 - CPM and Leak Detection. The procedure 
required that its CPM leak detection system comply with API RP 1130 in operating, maintaining,

41 See Violation Report at Exhibit G - NRC Report # 1318463.  Although it is common for operators to utilize third-
party contractors for NRC reporting, Beta Offshore failed to update its written procedures to memorialize this 
practice and therefore its conduct was not in accordance with its procedures at the time of the Failure. 

  
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
   
 
 
                                                 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
testing, record keeping, and dispatcher training of the system.42  Beta Offshore, however, failed 
to implement API RP 1130, Section 6.5 – “Pipeline Controller Training and Retraining,” which 
requires that the users of the CPM system (i.e., controllers) and any CPM support staff have 
appropriate CPM training. 

During the NTSB interviews, both controllers on duty during the Failure event stated that they 
were never trained on the ATMOS leak detection system at all.43  This is corroborated by the 
lack of records maintained by Beta Offshore demonstrating that for the past five years, 
controllers were trained to recognize leaks using ATMOS Leak Detection System, or were 
trained on Section 6.5 topics such as Hydraulics, Alarming/Performance, Data Presentation, 
Instrument Failure, Validating CPM Alarms, Line-pack Change (Online) Trending, CPM System 
Operation, Abnormal Functions, and other Leak Detection Techniques.44 

Despite Beta Offshore’s written procedures that required this training, its controllers were not 
trained on these topics, as evidenced by their actions during the Failure event.  For example, 
during the Failure, controllers continually shut the shipping pumps on and off (without closing 
any valves) in an effort to clear the alarms without performing additional actions to investigate 
the cause of the leak alarms.  During the NTSB Interviews, the night shift controller stated that 
controllers have been taught this practice and he has done it many times before.45 

(5) Beta Offshore failed to follow its Procedure 17.08 – Abnormal Operation  implementing the 
requirements set forth in § 195.402(d)(5).46  This procedure stated that the company “will 
undertake a review of personnel response … [and] …the review shall consider the actions taken, 
and whether the procedures followed were adequate….”47  Beta Offshore could not provide any 
records to demonstrate that operator personnel response to abnormal conditions had been

§ 195.446  Control room management. 

(a)  General.  This section applies to each operator of a pipeline facility with a 
controller working in a control room who monitors and controls all or part of a 
pipeline facility through a SCADA system.  Each operator must have and follow 
written control room management procedures that implement the requirements of 
this section.  The procedures required by this section must be integrated, as 
appropriate, with the operator's written procedures required by § 195.402. 
An operator must develop the procedures no later than August 1, 2011, and must 
implement the procedures according to the following schedule. The procedures 
required by paragraphs (b), (c)(5), (d)(2) and (d)(3), (f) and (g) of this section must 
be implemented no later than October 1, 2011. The procedures required by 
paragraphs (c)(1) through (4), (d)(1), (d)(4), and (e) must be implemented no later 
than August 1, 2012. The training procedures required by paragraph (h) must be 
implemented no later than August 1, 2012, except that any training required by 
another paragraph of this section must be implemented no later than the deadline 
for that paragraph. 

On multiple occasions, Beta Offshore failed to follow its written control room management 
procedures that implement the requirements of § 195.446, as detailed further below. 

(1) Beta Offshore failed to follow its CRM Procedure, Section 304-Shift Change Information and 
Accountability,  implementing  the  requirements  set  forth  in  §  195.446(b),  during  the  Failure 
event.49  Section 304 of Beta Offshore’s CRM procedure required the operator to use Form #304 
or equivalent to document shift change information and requires at least nine types of information 
that must be recorded, reviewed, and signed by both controllers that are part of the shift change.50 

Beta Offshore could not provide any records to demonstrate that Beta Offshore’s controllers 
documented the required minimum information listed above using the required Form 304 or 
equivalent during shift changes prior to and during the Failure event.51  In addition, during the

(a)  . . . . 
(b) Roles and responsibilities.  Each operator must define the roles and responsibilities of a controller during normal, 
abnormal, and emergency operating conditions. To provide for a controller's prompt and appropriate response to 
operating conditions, an operator must define each of the following:

NTSB Interviews, the controller stated that the shift change briefing is done verbally and 
controllers do not write down what is discussed or sign anything, despite the express 
requirements to do so in Beta Offshore’s written procedures.52 

(2) Beta Offshore failed to follow its CRM Procedure, Section 500 - Shift Lengths, Schedules, 
and Off-Duty Time, that implemented the requirements in § 195.446(d)(1) and (4),53 during the 
Failure event: 

CRM Procedure Section 500 - Shift Lengths, Schedules, and Off-Duty Time, Table 501A, stated 
that the maximum unscheduled hours during extended shifts when working on a 12-hour/shift 
schedule is 18 hours, and the minimum time off is 10 hours when working more than a 16 hours 
extended unscheduled shift.54  During the Failure event, Beta Offshore failed to follow this 
procedure by allowing its dayshift controller to work for 22.5 hours, from 4:30 am on Thursday, 
September 30, 2021, to 2:00 am on Friday, October 1, 2021.  Further, Beta Offshore failed to 
follow this procedure when it allowed that same controller to report for duty just two and a half 
hours after being released from his first shift at 5:00 am on October 1, 2021, thus not providing 
10 hours of time off, or 8 hours of continuous sleep.55 

CRM Procedure Section 500 further stated that “[t]he decision to work an extended shift greater 
than 16 hours shall be managed through section #108, deviation and exception process. 56 
Section 108 explained that Beta Offshore’s Compliance Specialist and/or Operations Supervisor 
may approve deviations to this manual, but only if the deviation does not relax this manual's 
requirements below those required by the applicable federal or state pipeline safety regulations. 
If the aforementioned party is unavailable, their supervisor may approve deviations on the advice 
of the supervision of the Control Room. Documentation of all deviations, including applicable 

produced sign-in sheets, it did not provide completed Form 304 documents, or equivalent forms that documented the 
required information.  

52 See Violation Report at Exhibit D - NTSB Interview Transcripts of Beta Offshore Personnel. 

53 § 195.446(d) Control room management. 
(a)  . . . . 
(d) Fatigue mitigation.  Each operator must implement the following methods to reduce the risk associated with 

controller fatigue that could inhibit a controller's ability to carry out the roles and responsibilities the operator has 
defined: 

(1) Establish shift lengths and schedule rotations that provide controllers off-duty time sufficient to achieve eight 

hours of continuous sleep; 

(4) Establish a maximum limit on controller hours-of-service, which may provide for an emergency deviation from 

the maximum limit if necessary for the safe operation of a pipeline facility. 

54 See Violation Report at Exhibit W - CRM Procedure, pg. 24. 

55 See Violation Report at Exhibit D - NTSB Interview Transcripts of Beta Offshore Personnel.  The controller 
awoke at 4:30 am and reported for duty at 5:00 am.

any form as long as it contains the required information.57 

Beta Offshore failed to provide records to demonstrate that the decision to require the dayshift 
controller to work an extended shift greater than 16 hours was managed in accordance with 
Section #108 of its CRM Procedure.  PHMSA’s Request for Specific Information Letter included 
a request to provide any records of deviation related to hours of service and alarm management 
changes from May 1 to October 4, 2021.  Beta Offshore did not provide any records in 
response. 

58 

(3) Beta Offshore failed to follow its CRM Procedure, 608-2 - Alarm Management Plan Review, 
that implements the requirements in § 195.446(e).  Its procedure stated that “[t]his review shall 
be conducted and documented by the Elly Control Room Operator, Elly Facilities Operator, Sr. 
Pipeline Tech, Pipeline Superintendent, and personnel knowledgeable in this area.”59 
Documents provided by Beta Offshore in response to PHMSA’s Request for Specific 
Information Letter failed to demonstrate that the Elly Control Room Operator, Elly Facilities 
operator, and Sr. Pipeline Tech had reviewed its Alarm Management Plan.60 

(4) Beta Offshore failed to follow its CRM procedure as required.  Specifically, an operators’ 
CRM procedure is required by §§ 195.446(a) and (e)(2) to identify at least once each calendar 
month the points affecting safety that have been taken off scan in the SCADA host, have had 
alarms inhibited, generated false alarms, or that have had forced or manual values for periods of 
time exceeding that required for associated maintenance or operating activities.  Beta Offshore’s 
procedure required compliance with this activity, but Beta Offshore was unable to demonstrate 
compliance during the inspection through records or any other means.61

demonstrate compliance with the requirements set forth in § 195.446). 

Despite having a written control room management procedure that incorporated the requirements set forth in § 
195.446(e)(2), and the requirement to follow its CRM Procedure pursuant to § 195.446(a), Beta Offshore stated in 
its response to PHMSA’s RSI that it completes this requirement by regularly reevaluating its alarm and safety 
equipment, but does not maintain records of these evaluations.  See Violation Report at Exhibit R - Beta Offshore 
Response Letters to PHMSA February 3, 2022’s Request for Specific Information, Response to Request #2; see also 
Violation Report at Exhibit W - CRM Procedure, pg. 47 (noting that Beta Offshore’s written procedures require that 
the minimum documentation for the monthly reviews of points taken off scan must include dates showing (1) when 
points were taken off scan/inhibited/forced/manual, (2) when points were restored, (3) the duration of outage, and 
(4) results of the review).

§ 195.446  Control room management. 

(a)  General.  This section applies to each operator of a pipeline facility with 
a controller working in a control room who monitors and controls all or part of 
a pipeline facility through a SCADA system.  Each operator must have and follow 
written control room management procedures that implement the requirements of 
this section.  The procedures required by this section must be integrated, as 
appropriate, with the operator's written procedures required by § 195.402. 
An operator must develop the procedures no later than August 1, 2011, and must 
implement the procedures according to the following schedule.  The procedures 
required by paragraphs (b), (c)(5), (d)(2) and (d)(3), (f) and (g) of this section must 
be implemented no later than October 1, 2011. The procedures required by 
paragraphs (c)(1) through (4), (d)(1), (d)(4), and (e) must be implemented no later 
than August 1, 2012.  The training procedures required by paragraph (h) must be 
implemented no later than August 1, 2012, except that any training required by 
another paragraph of this section must be implemented no later than the deadline 
for that paragraph. 

Beta Offshore failed to follow its CRM procedure as it relates to the requirement to monitor the 
content and volume of general activity being directed to and required of each controller at least 
once each calendar year, but at intervals not exceeding 15 months, that will assure controllers 
have sufficient time to analyze and react to incoming alarms.62  Beta Offshore’s procedure 
required compliance with this activity, but Beta Offshore was unable to demonstrate compliance 
during the inspection through records or any other means.63 

6. 

§195.446  Control room management. 

(a)  . . . . 

(b)  Roles and responsibilities. Each operator must define the roles and 
responsibilities of a controller during normal, abnormal, and emergency operating 
conditions. To provide for a controller's prompt and appropriate response to 
operating conditions, an operator must define each of the following: 

62 49 C.F.R. § 195.446(e)(5). 

63 See 49 C.F.R. § 195.446(j)(1) (requiring operators to maintain for review during inspection records that 
demonstrate compliance with the requirements set forth in § 195.446). 

Beta Offshore’s written control room management procedure that incorporated the requirements of this section also 
required documentation, stating that “[o]nce per calendar year or whenever significant changes are being made as 
determined by the MOC process, an activity review will be conducted by the Pipeline Superintendent, with the 
findings documented on memorandum or other acceptable method.”  See Violation Report at Exhibit W - CRM 
Procedure, pg. 45 and Violation Report at Exhibit R - Beta Offshore Response Letters to PHMSA February 3,

(5)  The roles, responsibilities and qualifications of others who have the authority to 
direct or supersede the specific technical actions of controllers. 

Beta Offshore did not define in its CRM procedures the roles, responsibilities and qualifications 
of others who have the authority to direct or supersede the specific technical actions of 
controllers.64  During the Failure event; the controller was directed by the Pipeline 
Superintendent to place the ATMOS leak detection system into “sleep” mode.65  Since the 
controller was unfamiliar with this task and had never performed it before, the Pipeline 
Superintendent provided verbal instructions over the telephone.66  The Pipeline Superintendent, 
however, was not identified in Beta Offshore’s written procedures as someone who had the 
authority to direct the controller’s actions.  The procedure also failed to document the Pipeline 
Superintendent’s required roles, responsibilities, or qualifications.

reduce the risk associated with controller fatigue that could inhibit a controller's 
ability to carry out the roles and responsibilities the operator has defined: 

(1)  . . . . 

(2) Educate controllers and supervisors in fatigue mitigation strategies and how off-
duty activities contribute to fatigue; 

(3) Train controllers and supervisors to recognize the effects of fatigue; and 

Beta Offshore failed to educate controllers and supervisors in fatigue, mitigation strategies and 
how off-duty activities contribute to fatigue, and train controllers and supervisors to recognize 
the effects of fatigue.  Despite Beta Offshore having a written control room management 
procedure noting that it would provide training on fatigue mitigation strategies once every three

§ 195.446  Control room management. 

(a)  . . . . 

(h)  Training.  Each operator must establish a controller training program and 
review the training program content to identify potential improvements at least 
once each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15 months.  An operator's 
program must provide for training each controller to carry out the roles and 
responsibilities defined by the operator.  In addition, the training program must 
include the following elements: 

Beta Offshore failed to provide training to its controllers to carry out the roles and 
responsibilities defined by the operator that includes (1) Responding to abnormal operating 
conditions likely to occur simultaneously or in sequence 69, (2) Providing controllers with a 
working knowledge of the pipeline system70, especially during the development of AOCs, (3) 
Providing an opportunity for controllers to review relevant procedures in advance of their 
application for setups that are periodically, but infrequently used,71 and (4) Providing control 
room team training and exercises that included both controllers and other individuals, defined by 
the operator, who would reasonably be expected to operationally collaborate with controllers 
(control room personnel) during normal, abnormal or emergency situations for the past three 
years. 72 Beta Offshore could not produce documents to demonstrate that Beta Offshore has 
provided training to its controllers and supervisors that covers these topics.73 

67 See Violation Report at Exhibit W - CRM Procedure, pg. 30.  In contrast, Fatigue Training records that were 
submitted by Beta Offshore in response to PHMSA’s Request for Specific Information notes that this training is to 
be conducted yearly. See Violation Report at Exhibit Y - Fatigue Training Records.

§ 195.505  Qualification program. 

Each operator shall have and follow a written qualification program.  The program 
shall include provisions to: 

(a)  . . . . 

(b)  Ensure through evaluation that individuals performing covered tasks are 
qualified; 

Beta Offshore failed to ensure a thorough evaluation that individuals performing covered tasks 
were qualified.  Specifically, the night shift controller who called in sick on September 30, 2021, 
was replaced by another person who was not qualified as a controller.  Beta Offshore informed 
PHMSA that this individual occasionally works in the control room, where he shadows a 
qualified controller as part of his training, and that he was not a qualified controller at the time of 
the Failure event.74  In addition, documents provided by Beta Offshore demonstrate that the 
controllers who were present at the time of the Failure had missed some years of the required 
training, and other personnel who were present and responded at the time of the Failure did not 
have the required training at all.75

§ 195.54  Accidents reports. 

(a)  Each operator that experiences an accident that is required to be reported 
under § 195.50 must, as soon as practicable, but not later than 30 days after 
discovery of the accident, file an accident report on DOT Form 7000-1. 

Beta Offshore failed to file an accident report on DOT Form 7000-1 as soon as practicable but 
not later than 30 days after the discovery of the Failure.  Specifically, Beta Offshore filed its 
accident report on December 3, 2021, which is more than 30 days after the discovery of the 
accident on October 1, 2021.76

76 See Violation Report at Exhibit Z – Accident Report. Shortly after the Failure, Beta Offshore initiated a series of 
discussions with PHMSA regarding the submission of the report and raised concerns regarding certain data inputs 
on the form.  In response, PHMSA provided instructions and feedback on filling out the form.  In addition, PHMSA 
provides detailed instructions for the written reports on its website.  See https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/forms/operator-
reports-submitted-phmsa-forms-and-instructions (last accessed Nov. 16, 2022).  Despite Beta Offshore having 
sufficient instructions, it did not complete the minimum required fields to allow for report submittal and therefore

1.  Amend procedure SPBPL-001.00 - SPBPL 16 Manual Leak Detection to: 

a.  Clearly define and provide an example(s) of what a 

“communication breakdown” is; and 

b.  Clearly define when to use the procedure. For example, can this 

procedure be used when the LDS is working? Should this 
procedure not to be used to verify an LDS leak alarm? etc.; and 

2.  Submit the revised procedure to PHMSA for review and approval within 

90 days of the receipt of the Final Order. 

B. 

In regard to Item 3 of the Notice pertaining to Beta Offshore’s failure to follow 
for each pipeline system a manual of written procedures for conducting normal 
operations and maintenance activities and handling abnormal operations and 
emergencies, Beta Offshore must complete the following to comply with §

(i.e., equipment maintenance, pigging operations, normal shipping, 
etc.); and 

b.  On page 5 of the procedure, under Abnormal Operating Conditions 
(AOC), clearly define the definition of “immediately shut down the 
pipeline” and when immediate shutdown should be employed (e.g., 
whenever an AOC is detected, or LDS issues a leak alarm, both 
scenarios, etc.,) 

2.  Amend SPBPL 16” SPBPL-009.11 - Emergency Shutdown, Isolation and 

Drawdown Procedure to include at a minimum: 

a.  A process on how to determine the location of a leak accurately, 
with detailed step-by-step instructions for a controller to follow; 
b.  A process on when and how a drawdown procedure can be used; 
c.  A process on when and how to safely return the pipeline to service 

after an emergency shutdown; and 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
d.  The title of the person who will be responsible for each specific 
task (i.e., Who is responsible for deciding if drawdown will be 
utilized? Who is responsible for shutting down the pump and 
closing the valve? etc.) 

3.  Amend Procedure 17.08 – Abnormal Operation to include at a minimum: 

a.  A form to document the investigation, corrective repairs, and 
replacement done for the abnormal operating conditions; 

b.  How often the review of personnel response to abnormal operating 

conditions to determine the effectiveness of the procedures 
controlling abnormal operation and taking corrective action where 
deficiencies are found will be done and a form to document the 
review; 

c.  Clearly define “shutting down the system.” For example, if an 

AOC occurs, what is the procedure to use for shutting down the 
system? 

4.  Submit the amended procedures to PHMSA for review and approval 

within 90 days of the receipt of the Final Order. 

5.  Prior to pipeline restart, submit to PHMSA for review the qualifications 

and training records of all controllers to demonstrate that they were trained 
pursuant to Section 6.5 of API Recommended Practice 1130, 
“Computational Pipeline Monitoring for Liquids: Pipeline Segment,” 3rd 
edition, September 2007, (API RP 1130) as required by Procedure 5.02 -
CPM and Leak Detection. 

C. 

D. 

In regard to Item 4 of the Notice pertaining to Beta Offshore’s failure to follow its 
written control room management procedures that implement the requirements of 
§ 195.446, specifically for failing to identify at least once each calendar month the 
points affecting safety that have been taken off scan in the SCADA host, have had 
alarms inhibited, generated false alarms, or that have had forced or manual values 
for periods of time exceeding that required for associated maintenance or 
operating activities, Beta Offshore must amend its CRM Procedure to include a 
detailed process on how a deficiency will be promptly remediated. 

In regard to Item 5 of the Notice pertaining to Beta Offshore’s failure to monitor 
the content and volume of general activity being directed to and required of each 
controller at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not exceeding 15 
months, that will assure controllers have sufficient time to analyze and react to 
incoming alarms, Beta Offshore must amend its CRM Procedure to include a 
detailed process for: 

1.  Identifying and measuring the workload (content and volume of general 

activity) being directed to an individual controller, and 

2.  Means of determining that the controller has sufficient time to analyze and 

react to incoming alarms.
