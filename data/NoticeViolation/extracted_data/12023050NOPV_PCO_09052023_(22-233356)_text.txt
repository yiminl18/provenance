NOTICE OF PROBABLE VIOLATION 
and 
PROPOSED COMPLIANCE ORDER 

OVERNIGHT EXPRESS DELIVERY 

September 5, 2023 

Mr. Zachary Young 
Vice President of Ergon Trucking 
Ergon Terminaling, Inc. 
P.O. Box 1639 
Jackson, MS 39215 

Dear Mr. Young: 

CPF 1-2023-050-NOPV 

From May 16, 2022 to May 20, 2022, representatives of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 
Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), pursuant to Chapter 601 of 49 
United States Code (U.S.C.) conducted an on-site inspection of Ergon Terminaling, Inc.’s (Ergon) 
procedures and records for control room management of its control room in Magnolia, Ohio. 

As  a  result  of  the  inspection,  it  is  alleged  that  you  have  committed  probable  violations  of  the 
Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The items inspected 
and the probable violations are: 

1. 

§ 195.446 Control Room Management. 

(a)  General.  This  section  applies  to  each  operator  of  a  pipeline 
facility with a controller working in a control room who monitors and 
controls all or part of a pipeline facility through a SCADA system. Each 
operator  must  have  and  follow  written  control  room  management 
procedures that implement the requirements of this section… 

Ergon failed to follow its written control room management procedures.  Specifically, Ergon failed 
to follow its Control Room Management Plan, November 2014 (CRM Plan), Section 7.8 regarding 
monitoring  the  content  and  volume  of  general  activity  being  directed  to  and  required  of  each 
controller at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not exceeding 15 months that will assure 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
controllers have sufficient time to analyze and react to incoming alarms.  Section 195.446(e)(5)1 
requires that Ergon “[m]onitor the content and volume of general activity being directed to and 
required  of  each  controller  at  least  once  each  calendar  year,  but  at  intervals  not  exceeding  15 
months . . .” 

Ergon’s CRM Plan, Section 7.8 stated, in part, “ETI monitors the content and volume of general 
activity being directed to and required of each controller at least once each calendar year (not to 
exceed 15 months),  to assure controllers have  sufficient  time  to analyze  and react to incoming 
alarms.” 

During  the  inspection,  Ergon  was  asked  to  produce  records  indicating  that  they  monitored  the 
content and volume of general activity being directed to and required of each controller at least 
once each calendar year but at intervals not exceeding 15 months, to assure that its controllers have 
sufficient  time  to  analyze  and  react  to  incoming  alarms.  Ergon  produced  a  study  that  was 
undertaken  in  August  2014.  While  the  CRM  Plan  and  regulations  required  this  task  to  be 
completed  each  calendar  year,  no  records  or  study  were  presented  for  2019,  2020  and  2021. 
Section 194.446(j)(1) requires operators to maintain records that demonstrate compliance with the 
requirements of this section. 

In  addition,  Ergon’s  CRM  Plan,  Section  7.8.2  was  not  fully  consistent  with  Section  7.8  as  it 
required Ergon to perform this workload analysis “periodically, annually and/or whenever or [sic] 
significant changes are being made.” 

Therefore, Ergon failed to follow its written control room procedures pursuant to compliance with 
§§ 195.446(a) and 195.446(e)(5) during 2019 to 2021. 

2. 

§ 195.446 Control Room Management. 

(a)  General.  This  section  applies  to  each  operator  of  a  pipeline 
facility with a controller working in a control room who monitors and 
controls all or part of a pipeline facility through a SCADA system. Each 
operator  must  have  and  follow  written  control  room  management 
procedures that implement the requirements of this section… 

Ergon failed to follow its written control room management procedures.  Specifically, Ergon failed 
to follow its Control Room Management Plan, November 2014 (CRM Plan), Section 7.7 regarding 
reviewing its Alarm Management Plan to determine its effectiveness pursuant to § 195.446(e)(4)2. 

1 § 195.446 Control Room Management. 
(a) … 
(e) Alarm management. Each operator using a SCADA system must have a written alarm management plan to 
provide for effective controller response to alarms. An operator's plan must include provisions to: 
(1) … 
(5) Monitor the content and volume of general activity being directed to and required of each controller at least once 
each calendar year, but at intervals not exceeding 15 months, that will assure controllers have sufficient time to 
analyze and react to incoming alarms;
2  § 195.446 Control Room Management. 
(a) … 

 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
Ergon’s CRM Plan, Section 7.7 required, in part, that “ET will review the Alarm Management 
Plan at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not exceeding 15 months, to determine the 
effectiveness of the plan.”  Section 7.7 also stated, “[r]eview of the alarm management plan must 
be documented in the “Record of Plan Revisions”, even if no changes are made.” 

During the inspection, Ergon was asked to produce documentation indicating that a review of the 
alarm management plan was conducted during 2019 – 2021.  Ergon was unable to provide any 
records  demonstrating  that  the  annual  reviews  were  conducted  and  documented  pursuant  to  its 
procedures above. 

Therefore, Ergon failed to follow its written procedures regarding conducting annual reviews of 
its alarm management plan pursuant to §§ 195.446 (a) and 195.446(e)(4). 

3. 

§ 195.446 Control Room Management. 

(a) … 
(j)  Compliance  and  deviations.  An  operator  must  maintain  for 

review during inspection: 

(1) Records that demonstrate compliance with the requirements of 

this section; and 

Ergon failed to maintain records as required by § 195.446(j)(1) that demonstrate compliance with 
§§ 195.446(d)(2) and 195.446(d)(3)3.  Specifically, Ergon failed to maintain records demonstrating 
that controllers and supervisors were educated in fatigue mitigation strategies and how off-duty 
activities  contribute  to  fatigue,  and  records  demonstrating  they  were  trained  to  recognize  the 
effects of fatigue for years 2020 and 2021. 

During the inspection, Ergon was asked to produce records to demonstrate that fatigue education 
and training was conducted pursuant to §§ 195.446(d)(2) and 195.446(d)(3).  Ergon discussed that 
they did not have training records for 2020, 2021 and prior years.  In discussions during the verbal 
exit briefing,  Ergon stated that  all employees  at the  Magnolia  Terminal facility are required to 
qualify as pipeline operators and do receive Fatigue Mitigation Training via the Empower Human 
Resource  Management  system  and  electronic  records  are  available  for  review.  However,  the 

(e) Alarm management. Each operator using a SCADA system must have a written alarm management plan to 
provide for effective controller response to alarms. An operator's plan must include provisions to: 
(1) … 
(4) Review the alarm management plan required by this paragraph at least once each calendar year, but at least 
intervals not exceeding 15 months, to determine the effectiveness of the plan. 

3 § 195.446 Control Room Management. 
(a) … 
(d) Fatigue Mitigation. Each operator must implement the following methods to reduce the risk associated with 
controller fatigue that could inhibit a controller’s ability to carry out the roles and responsibilities the operator has 
defined: 
(1)  … 
(2) Educate controllers and supervisors in fatigue mitigation strategies and how off-duty activities contribute to 
fatigue; 
(3) Train controllers and supervisors to recognize the effects of fatigue: and 

 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
operator  was  unable  to  produce  records  when  requested.  In  communication  subsequent  to  the 
inspection,  Ergon  identified  that  required  training  was  added  post-inspection,  and  that  Ergon 
conducted fatigue mitigation training between May 9, 2022 and June 28, 2022. 

Therefore,  Ergon  failed  to  maintain  records  under  §  195.446(j)(1)  demonstrating  that  the 
controllers and supervisors were educated and trained regarding fatigue mitigation as required by 
§§ 195.446(d)(2) and 195.446(d)(3). 

4. 

§ 195.446 Control Room Management. 

(a) … 
(j)  Compliance  and  deviations.  An  operator  must  maintain  for 

review during inspection: 

(1) Records that demonstrate compliance with the requirements of 

this section; and 

Ergon failed to maintain records as required by § 195.446(j)(1) that demonstrate compliance with 
§ 195.446(b)(4).  Specifically, Ergon failed to maintain documentation of shift-handover notes to 
the temporary relief or any other controllers as required by § 195.446(b)(4)4. 

Ergon’s  Pipeline  Control Room Management  Plan,  November  2014, Section 5.1 stated that its 
controller will document abnormal conditions, if any exist. It also required the conveying of all 
necessary information if a temporary or impromptu change in controller responsibility occurs. 

During the inspection, Ergon discussed how it has day shifts only and there are no regular shift 
turnover  meetings  performed.  However,  Ergon  stated  that  they  sometimes  conduct  shift 
handovers, but did not retain records documenting the shift handover and information exchanged 
during  the  shift  change.  Therefore,  no  records  were  provided  documenting  hand-over 
responsibility between controllers. 

Therefore, Ergon failed to maintain records of shift handover of responsibility between controllers 
pursuant to § 195.446(b)(4), as required by § 195.446(j)(1). 

Proposed Civil Penalty 

Under 49 U.S.C. § 60122 and 49 CFR § 190.223, you are subject to a civil penalty not to exceed 
$257,664 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,576,627 for a related 
series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after March 21, 2022 and before January 6, 
2023, the maximum penalty may not exceed $239,142 per violation per day the violation persists, 
up to a maximum of $2,391,412 for a related series of violations.  For violation occurring on or 
after May 3, 2021 and before March 21, 2022, the maximum penalty may not exceed $225,134 

4 § 195.446 Control Room Management. 
(a) … 
(b) Roles and responsibilities. Each operator must define the roles and responsibilities of a controller during normal, 
abnormal and emergency operating conditions. To provide for a controller’s prompt and appropriate response to 
operating conditions, an operator must define each of the following: 
(1) … 
(4) A method of recording controller shift-changes and any hand-over of responsibility between controllers; and 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
per violation per day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,251,334 for a related series of 
violations.    For  violation  occurring  on  or  after  January  11,  2021  and  before  May  3,  2021,  the 
maximum penalty may not exceed $222,504 per violation per day the violation persists, up to a 
maximum of $2,225,034 for a related series of violations.  For violation occurring on or after July 
31,  2019  and  before  January  11,  2021,  the  maximum  penalty  may  not  exceed  $218,647  per 
violation  per  day  the  violation  persists,  up  to  a  maximum  of  $2,186,465  for  a  related  series  of 
violations.  For violation occurring on or after November 27, 2018 and before July 31, 2019, the 
maximum penalty may not exceed $213,268 per violation per day, with a maximum penalty not to 
exceed $2,132,679.  For violation occurring on or after November 2, 2015 and before November 
27, 2018, the maximum penalty may not exceed $209,002 per violation per day, with a maximum 
penalty not to exceed $2,090,022. 

We have reviewed the circumstances and supporting documents involved in this case, and have
